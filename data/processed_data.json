Collaboration with others is going be helpful. ROE is not proctored and is open internet. There is a reason for that. Its very hard.\nThere will be a dataset or multiple datasets. Sometimes you may have to combine datasets to answer questions. You will have to extract data from the dataset. You will have to transform/clean the data and you will have to gain some information from the data, is what typical ROEs test.\nKind regards"

While I understand the necessity of these tutorials, they lack immediate exercises, which makes it difficult to retain the knowledge gained. Attempting to practice everything from these tutorials leaves insufficient time for other courses.\nAdditionally, while solving GAs helps reinforce learning, they don’t seem to cover all the concepts from the tutorials.\nI would want to know whether the learning from GAs is sufficient or if there’s a better way to balance this.\nPS - To address this at a management level, my suggestion would be to introduce AQs  or  mini exercises after each module. Alternatively, we could increase questions in GAs to cover more concepts, though the first approach might be more effective. Another improvement could be to reduce the diversity of content in a single week to make it more manageable."

These are not set in stone and still is in the design/validation phase.\nWe generally avoid calling it week 3 content etc. because all the content was released as modules at the beginning well before the term was started.\nThe GAs are released as we complete validations on them. Each term the course assignments are updated to stay current with industry expectations. So they are not recycled like subjects that are static like maths, statistics and programming which have syllabi that have not changed in 10 years or more.\nWe try to release GAs so that they match the cadence of the other subjects for the convenience of students wherever possible. But rarely do other subjects require constant revalidation for their GAs.\nHence we have situations, even in past terms, where GAs and Projects get moved to allow for robust validations of the answers. In spite of this some errors do slip through due to the aggressive time schedule in a trimester system as opposed to a semester system.\nHope that give you some insight into how TDS works.\nThanks for bearing with us.

    "content": "Dear\n@jkmadathil\n@Anand\n@Bharathi\nFirst and foremost, we sincerely appreciate the efforts of the\nTDS team\nin supporting us throughout this course. The\nlive sessions and guidance\nhave been helpful, and we recognize the intent to make this a valuable learning experience.\nHowever, despite these efforts, many of us have faced significant challenges in keeping up with the course expectations.\nKey Challenges Faced\nLack of Prerequisites\nThis course did not list any\nprerequisites\n, leading many students—including those from\nnon-technical backgrounds\n—to enroll with the expectation that they could keep up. However, the reality is that the\ncourse content, assignments, and projects\nhave been far more complex than anticipated, making it difficult to manage.\nProject Complexity & Deadline Pressure\nThe\ndifficulty of the projects\nhas been overwhelming, requiring most of us to\nrely heavily on peer support\njust to meet the deadlines. Despite putting in our best efforts, many of us struggled to complete them successfully.\nCourse Structure Changes & Misleading Past Feedback\nMany students joined\nTDS\nbased on past\nDiscourse posts and feedback\n, which suggested a different course structure. With the recent changes, it has been a tough transition—especially for\nworking professionals\nand students without prior experience.\nRemote Open Exam (RoE) & Graded Assignments (GAs)\nWhile we have put in significant effort—spending\n2-3 days on Graded Assignments (GAs)\nto secure good scores—we still find ourselves\nstruggling to meet expectations\nfor the\nprojects and RoE\n, which are significantly harder than anticipated.\nWe completely understand the need to maintain academic standards, but we also hope fairness is considered. Since many of us are putting in our best efforts but still finding it hard to meet the course demands, we kindly request a revision of the grading pattern. Increasing the weightage of Graded Assignments (GAs) would help ensure that the dedication and hard work of students are fairly reflected in their grades. This would allow students to pass with a reasonable grade while still maintaining the integrity of the course.\nWe truly respect the effort that has gone into designing this course, and we are all here because we genuinely want to learn and grow. We only ask that the grading structure consider the diverse backgrounds of students so that everyone has a fair chance to succeed.\nThank you for your time and understanding. We appreciate your consideration and hope to find a way forward that benefits both students and the course objectives."

    "content": "Hi\n@s.anand\n@jkmadathil\n@Bharathi\n@carlton\n@Jivraj\n@Saransh_Saini\nCould you please look into the above issue?\nAdditionally, I’d like to highlight a concern regarding the current grading pattern ( JAN 2025 Term ) and overall course structuring:\nGrading Concerns\nFinal Course Score:\nT = 0.15GAA + 0.2 ROE1 + 0.2 P1 + 0.2 P2 + 0.25 F\n(The weightage of Projects + ROE accounts for 60% of the total score.)\nFrom the following Discourse post, it appears that the ROE exam is extremely difficult to the point of being considered “impossible” by students:\nWhat’s the actual purpose of impossible ROE exam?\n.\nGiven this, many students may directly lose 20 marks due to ROE, significantly impacting their overall scores.\nFurthermore, for Project 1 (\ndeadline: 16th Feb 2025\n), guidance was provided only in the week of the deadline. This was highly inconvenient, as the live session did not effectively address all student concerns. As a result, many students are at risk of losing a valuable 20 marks for Project 1.\nCourse Structuring & Scheduling Issues\nMany students pursuing this course are\ndual-degree students or working professionals\n, making it challenging to keep up with live sessions and deadlines.\nThe\nlast-minute guidance\nfor projects adds unnecessary pressure, especially for those juggling work or other academic commitments.\nThe\nstructuring and scheduling of sessions\nfeel inappropriate, with crucial guidance sessions being held too late, making it difficult to implement feedback or clarify doubts in time.\nRequest for Improvement\nTo ensure a smoother learning experience, I request:\nEarly guidance and detailed instructions for Project 2\n, well in advance of the deadline.\nMore structured and accessible support\n, considering the diverse student base, including working professionals.\nBetter management of exam difficulty levels\n, ensuring that assessments are fair and reflect actual learning rather than being unnecessarily tough.\nI hope these concerns can be taken into account, and necessary improvements can be made. Looking forward to your response."

    "content": "Thank you\n@A_LAKSHMI\nfor the detailed post. This is much appreciated. Thought of quickly stepping in before Anand or other members from the course team gives a more detailed response.\nLet me be Open and Blunt to all in saying that the\ngrading pattern will not be changed\n.  And the points below are some of quick things that came to my mind while reading the detailed listing of the challenges that have been put in the OP.\nTDS team have been tinkering with the course structure for the past 3 terms. You can check this\nDiscourse thread\nwhere students have unanimously said that this is not an easy subject. In fact the\nfirst page of the TDS course\nGA1 itself should have given everyone an indication of what lies ahead. Anand has explicitly written down the below words:\nThis course is quite hard\nHere’s students’ feedback:\nIt\nused\nto be an easy course until 2024.\n#\n#\n#\nNow it’s hard and covers more. Take it in your last semester if possible.\n#\n#\n#\nPlan extra time. It takes more time than typical 3-credit courses.\n#\n#\n#\nLLMs grade you – unpredictably.\n#\n#\nThe ROE is hard.\n#\nTake Graded assignment 1\nto check if you’re ready for this course.\nPlease drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It’ll be too tough for you now.\nTDS (or for that matter any course in this Degree program) is not supposed to be a single person effort. You should be realizing this even in your real life. A significant part of our learning process is social by nature. The only difference in this course is that we we explicitly encourage you to collaborate. If there is one main life lesson that we want you to learn out of this course then it is just this -\nSurviving tough situations require support all around us, and there is no shame in asking for help\nAgain to quote Anand:\nWe encourage learning by sharing\nYou\nCAN\ncopy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam).\nWhy should you copy?\nBecause in real life, there’s no time to re-invent the wheel. You’ll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It’s important to learn how to do that well.\nTo learn well, understand\nwhat you’re copying. If you’re short of time, prioritize.\nTo learn better, teach\nwhat you’ve learnt.\nNow will be a good point to reflect on the optimization problem of Grades versus Learning. The larger question for each of you is to consider the short-term advantage of better grades versus the long term advantage of improving the fundamentals related to tools usage (not just for Data Science, but in every day life itself).\nOnce again Anand has a\nnice blog\nwhere [I think] he is trying to explain that neither do we know nor do students realize what is going to ultimately benefit us. This is a journey that all of us are taking together, and we hope such open interactions along with the course will make the learning (or teaching) experience enjoyable  and internally make us more humble.\nWhether you like it or not, life is becoming more complex day by day. And unless you figure out your optimization strategy, it is going to be a bumpy ride. And this is true even for the TDS course team members. Each of us are also juggling multiple responsibilities (some even doing 4 projects in this term) while ensuring that needed support can be provided to the learners. This is not lighten the issues that any of you have highlighted here, but just to point out that there is no flowery path for anyone here.\nThen the major question will be, why are all of doing this crazy business of learning tools in this way. The simplest answer is -\nTools are evolving day by day, and unless we realize that they are just “tools”, it is going to consume us an eternity to master them\nThe point of all the exercises and assessments, is for you to understand the fundamental aspects related to a tool and figure out your own strategies for getting a grip on them.\n@22f2001640\nManagement of time and difficulty levels are a shared responsibility. All of you have been sufficiently warned that the learning process wont be easy. In fact we have released all major content well in advance, so that learners can benefit from early access. And from our side, we also have realized the supporting learners wouldn’t be easy. But I see that the TDS course team members have been putting their heart and soul in this course (and support), and even in this week they have prepared 3 sets of ROEs in order to ensure that all of you get enough practice opportunity."

    "content": "Regarding your point of the short term benefits of grades vs the long term benefits of learning, I think I’m speaking for a lot of my peers that we’re not concerned about grades at this point, we just at least want to pass this course.\nI’m a standalone degree potential student and while I have learned a lot from the modules and do not condone dumbing it down, but at least after all this hard work I should be able to pass the course.\nWhile grades don’t matter in front of learning things but when passing the course itself is on the line then the learnings are overshadowed by the lack of marks. I want to invest myself in the ROE and the remaining project, but at this point I’m so frustrated about getting at least 40 that rather than a valuable learning experience, this course seems like a burden to me.\nI understand that the grading can’t be changed. All I hope and request that project 2 and end term turn out to be more approachable than project 1 and ROE so that after all this hard work, students like me at least get the privilege to pass."

( Mentioned that as per industrial standards/ needs).\nAdditional programming skills are required(in addition to Python) to follow the TDS Course. That means indirectly, one should complete many courses diploma in programming before doing TDS.\nIn such a case, how to drop the course Tools In Data Science(already registered) and get it replaced with another course to save time and without incurring financial losses(as dropping a course refunds only a certain percentage of fees amount paid for the course), and do it again later in terms. It’s completely IIT Madras’s fault since it was mentioned in the academics site that no prerequisites were required for the course while the reality turned out to be far from promises. I want to either get the course structure for the TDS revised or get it replaced with some another course; incase of some course fee difference, I will pay the difference amount."

Initially, I attempted a simpler approach, using various JSON extraction functions. However, I encountered multiple errors, including:\njson_extract\n:\n“Table Function with name ‘json_extract’ is not in the catalog. A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.”\njson_each\n:\n“Table Function with name ‘json_each’ is not in the catalog. A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.”\njson_extract_path_text\n:\n“Table Function with name ‘json_extract_path_text’ is not in the catalog. A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.”\nSince the simple approach did not work, I attempted a more complex query to achieve the desired result. However, that too did not yield the expected output. To gain better insight, I extracted ten values into a table using the console and then reconstructed the query accordingly. Unfortunately, I am still facing issues related to functions not being recognized in the catalog.\nI would appreciate any guidance on resolving this issue.

    "content": "QUESTION 9\nI was supposed to transcribe the audio of the provided video for a certain time period. After several attempts my submission still generated differences from the supposed answers. I have tried all forms of re-punctuations but the error wont budge. I even compared the generated transcript with the actual audio several times. I BELIEVE MY ANSWER IS CORRECT. If not I wish to know what the correct answer is. Because compared to the video I have provided the exact and well punctuated transcription of the audio between 397.2 and 505.5 seconds.\nHere was my transcription - \" Determined to confront the mystery, Miranda followed the elusive figure. In the dim corridor, fleeting glimpses of determination and hidden sorrow emerged, challenging her assumptions of friends and foes alike. The pursuit led her to a narrow, winding passage beneath the chapel. In the oppressive darkness, the air grew cold and heavy, and every echo of her footsteps seemed to whisper warnings of secrets best left undisturbed.\nIn a subterranean chamber, the shadow finally halted. The figure’s voice emerged from the gloom, “You are close to the truth, but be warned some secrets, once uncovered, can never be buried again.”\nThe mysterious stranger introduced himself as Victor, a former confidant of Edmund. His words painted a tale of coercion and betrayal—a network of hidden alliances that had forced Edmond into an impossible choice.\nVictor detailed clandestine meetings, cryptic codes, and a secret society that manipulated fate from behind the scenes. Miranda listened, each revelation tightening the knots of suspicion around her mind.\nFrom within his warm coat, Victor produced a faded journal brimming with names, dates, and enigmatic symbols. Its contents mirrored Edmund’s diary, strengthening the case for a conspiracy rooted in treachery. The journal hinted at a hidden hall beneath the manor, where the secret society stored evidence of their manipulations.\nMiranda’s pulse quickened at the thought of unmasking those responsible for decades of deceit. Returning to the manor’s main hall, Miranda retraced her steps with renewed resolve. Every shadow in the corridor now seemed charged with meaning, each creak of wood a prelude to further revelations. In the manor’s basement, beneath a concealed panel, Miranda discovered another revelation \""

Here are the highlights of the discussion:\nWe have moved Graded Assignment 5 (GA5) deadline which was due on 16th Feb to 21st Feb next Friday.\nAll the material to be able to do Project was available in Module 2 and Module 3, which was released on or before 10th of January (36 days ago)\nProject 1 was released 19th of January (27 days ago)\nWe had over 9 hours of sessions exclusively covering Project 1 (of which at least 8 hours are available on YouTube.) This excludes any week 2 and week 3 content which also would have given you the necessary skills to do Project 1. The sessions on YouTube give you a start to finish overview of how to approach it.\nAll of your concerns were duly noted and mentioned. Considering all the above, including the concerns mentioned by students:\nProject 1 deadline will NOT be changed.\nPlease make sure to carefully read the Deliverables and the Evaluation section and do them carefully and watch the intro to Week 3 - Session 1 to get an overview of what is absolutely essential and required. Watch Week 5 both sessions to see how we construct these requirements.\nKind regards\nTDS Team"

(Some have Gate exam on Saturday also). So, extending the timeline to at least Sunday, 16th Feb would be truly appreciated.\nWeek 3 release date timeline is 24 Jan, we need adequate time to go through the weekly materials. All the contents are already released, so by the same logic upcoming Project 2 contents are also available but that doesn’t mean that we can complete the upcoming project within a week.\nProject help sessions came on 11th February(live) and 12th Feb on YouTube, just 4 days before the submission date, though I am not complaining about this and genuinely appreciating the team’s effort, but this does gives very less time for many of us here.\nThank you."

As many students are finding it challenging to achieve high score in Project 1 and have been requesting an extension for the deadline. Instead of extending the deadline, I propose adjusting the weightage, allocating 15% to Project 1 and 25% to Project 2.\nThis adjustment seems fair, as Project 2 requires students to build upon the concepts used in Project 1. By making this change, it would provide additional time for improvement and potentially help those who struggled with the first project to to get good scores, without disadvantaging those who performed well initially.\nWould it be possible to implement this change?"

I had submitted the ROE on time before 1:45 PM, though I was unaware that submissions were allowed until 1:47 PM.\nEven after the deadline, I attempted to increase my marks upon learning about the method to unlock the ROE. While I did make changes after the deadline, my initial submission before 1:45 PM had already secured some marks, meaning I was not absent. Additionally, I recall you mentioning in Project 1 that students should focus on the learning experience rather than just the marks when someone said that this term’s project was tougher than the last.\nEven if my increased marks were obtained after the deadline, they were still achieved by following all the given instructions and on my own terms and also everyone has different questions. If those changes were submitted in the same manner, I am unsure why they are not being considered. I understand it’s my mistake that I was not able to solve the entire ga in time but I had conditions which I had submitted in the feedback google form. Since this is a standalone degree for me, I’m actually worried about it.

I wanted to check if it is mandatory to attempt the mock at 7 PM or if there is flexibility in the timing. As a working professional, I may not be able to attempt the mock at 7 PM.\nCould you please confirm if there is any flexibility in the timings? Additionally, I would appreciate it if you could provide details on when and how the mock links will be shared.\nThanks and Regards\nShalini"

    "content": "It is not mandatory to attempt mocks at 7pm. But we will solve it in real time during the session. Thats why we are releasing it 1 hour before. We will freeze the form submissions during the solving session and then reopen it later.\nROE is not like other exams you have done so far in this entire diploma.\nSolving it leisurely will give you a false sense of your capabilities.\nThe truth is everyone can get full marks for ROE given enough time.\nThe problem is the lack of time.\nSo if you want to really check ROE readiness, fix the timer alarm for 45 mins and attempt it genuinely within the 45 mins. Only then will you know where you stand.\nAdditionally, each ROE is completely different from the next. If you manage to do good in one is ZERO guarantee that you will do good in the next.\nThats why do all 4 mock ROEs. ROE is not like any other exam. Other exams have the same types of questions. Not with ROE.\nThe real ROE will be also something that no one has seen before.\nBut we will help you be as ready as possible for it.\nKind regards"

    "content": "@s.anand\n@carlton\n@Jivraj\n@Saransh_Saini\nDear Sir,\nI have few questions. It is written in the\nTools in Data Science\nthat we can expose the api using vercel (the example given also uses vercel). But I don’t think vercel can handle/allow many operations, some of them are listed below.\nIn GA 1 ques 13 and  GA 2 Ques 7, we have to create github repo, then creating github actions and then retrieve the raw github file url. We can accomplish this using Github CLI\ngh\nwhich we have to install in the vercel instance using\napt\npackage manager.\nBut, Vercel does not provide sudo access which is required to install packages.\nIn GA 2 ques 10, we have to use local LLM (Llamafile), will vercel allow that?\nAlso after that, we have to give answer as the ngrok public url for which we have to first install\nngrok\npackage.\nIn GA 2 ques 8,  uploading an image to Dockerhub requires\ndocker\npackage installed.\nIn GA 2 ques 6, Deploy a Python API to Vercel in a Vercel instance?\nMany ques require writing and running FastAPI server to serve data with CORS enabled. Can Vercel allow/do that?\nAnd many more\nMost tasks mentioned above like installing packages etc. requires sudo privilages or may face restrictions set by Vercel.\nVercel does not provide sudo access or any form of root access to its hosting environment which is required to perform the above tasks.\nMany of these task can be done in our local systems (exposing to internet using cloudflare tunnels/ngrok), but we cannot run our systems 24*7 during evaluation.\nI can see only one option left that is renting a VPS from server providers like digitalocean, gcp, aws etc, which will provide us sudo access and 100% uptime.\nAlso, some ques requires external toolings like\nIn GA1 ques 5, it is written to explicitly use Excel and this will only work in Office 365.\nIn GA1 ques 6, we have to use Devtools to show/find the hidden element in the question. Now, the question parameter in the POST request will be plain text, so how the element can hide there?\nGA 2 ques 4 and GA 2 ques 5 uses Google Colab specific python libraries like google.colab which can’t be installed locally.\nHow to solve these above questions that require explicit usage of external tools.\nAlso, handling POST request for some questions are not clear like\nIn GA 2 ques 2, we have to compress the image and upload the image as answer. So, now how to response such answer in json object. Should we encode the resultant compressed image as base64 string or Image URL or  Data URI.\nSome ques have images in them. For those images in GAs, I right clicked and used “Save as” to save the images and then done the required computations. So, now when this question will be sent as POST request, will the image be included as the base64 encoded string in the question parameter of the POST request itself or as an optional file attachment?\nAnother concern is regarding the OpenAI API TOKEN, unlike Project 1, Project 2 does not have an API_TOKEN parameter in the POST request. Hence, the API TOKEN provided from\nhttps://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev\nwill be also used during evaluation. Now, what will happen if our API TOKEN credits gets end during evaluation. The LLM will throw errors then.\nPlease advise what we should do. please clarify Sir."

Would like your thoughts and suggestions over the same.\nCurrently answers that we have entered for GA’s 1 to 4 are not available and only for GA5 its available. It would be helpful for the project (when running the Curl command for each of the question) if the assignments can display the answers we’ve entered as well for verification purposes.\nThe first question of GA1 q1 needs for us to run vs code but when executing it through vercel its not possible because vercel is a serverless environment. In this case, is it okay to manually enter the answer in the code, so when the question is triggered it takes the manual output from the code.\nCan you provide some clarity as to how the question is supposed to be and structured ? Or should the code be able to handle multiple variants of the question? To address this concern, i tried to implement sentence_transformers using a lightweight model but the vercel application build failed saying that the data is too long and that Vercel serverless function deployment size exceeds the limit of 250 MB. Should i consider deploying elsewhere or change the approach?\nHow do we handle questions pertaining to Devtools - creating input box etc.\nThanks and Regards\nShalini"

    "content": "I just want to know if you prefer using an existing language model application where we utilize an LLM (Large Language Model), train it, and format the output. For instance, I used the Gemini API key, integrated it with Python, and then formatted the results with the help of Copilot to achieve the desired outputs.\nAlternatively, do you want us to create a new LLM model and train it with questions from graded assignments? I’m curious about your preference.\nAdditionally, would you like the LLM to provide specific answers regarding computer specifications, or should it give general specifications? For example, in Graded Assignment 1, there is a question about the editor: Visual Studio Code.\nYour editor is the most important tool in your arsenal; that’s where you’ll spend most of your time, so make sure you’re comfortable with it.\nVisual Studio Code is, by far, the most popular code editor today. According to the 2024 Stack Overflow Survey, almost 75% of developers use it. We recommend you learn it well. Even if you use another editor, you’ll likely work with others who use VS Code, so having some exposure is beneficial.\nTo get started, you can watch these introductory videos (totaling 35 minutes) from the Visual Studio Docs:\nGetting Started: Set up and learn the basics of Visual Studio Code (7 min)\nCode Editing: Learn how to edit and run code in VS Code (3 min)\nProductivity Tips: Become a VS Code power user with these productivity tips (4 min)\nPersonalize: Personalize VS Code to make it yours with themes (2 min)\nExtensions: Add features, themes, and more to VS Code with extensions (4 min)\nDebugging: Get started with debugging in VS Code (6 min)\nVersion Control: Learn how to use Git version control in VS Code (3 min)\nCustomize: Learn how to customize your settings and keyboard shortcuts in VS Code (6 min)\nAI Editors: Copilot, Cursor\nNote: AI editors like Cursor, Cody, and GitHub Copilot use LLMs to help you write code faster. These tools are built on top of VS Code and have become standard in every developer’s toolkit. Please make sure to use them.\nTo install and run Visual Studio Code, open your Terminal (or Command Prompt) and type\ncode -s\n, then press Enter. Copy and paste the entire output below.\nWhat is the output of\ncode -s\n? The output of\ncode -s\ncannot be universally answered because it depends on the user’s system and the specific version of VS Code installed. The question requests the output of a command that is unique to each user.\nAs for the part about getting answers from the LLM model, I believe that may require using an AI agent. I am currently searching for a solution for this, and I would like to know your thoughts on it.\nimage\n1214×831 34.8 KB"

I am facing issue with zip file extraction function which is in many GA1 questions. e.g., for GA1 Q15, if I use 7-zip to extract files, it shows the correct total size when using Postman for local server. If I use python built-in function, it calculates a different value (which is incorrect). So, I used 7-zip. But I (with help from copilot agent) am not able to make 7-zip work on the vercel deployment. Can we just hard code the answers to GA1 questions, or is there a way to take answer from local server and use it for response in vercel (sorry, it doesn’t even make sense to me, but a lot of things are hard to understand anyway)? Or how do we resolve this 7-zip issue. Python built-in extraction did not work correctly even after hours of trying..\nI have another question. Due to lack of time, if I just submit the Project 2, with question/answers to GA1, (and if these all work as expected on vercel), how much approx score can we get if I am not able to do other GAs at all for Project 2. Edit after posting: I can hard code questions and other answers from GA2 upto GA4 (I missed GA5, so don’t have those answers). Thank you."

All movie names are provided in English, but the portal seems to be accepting some titles in other languages—Spanish, Dutch, I believe.\nQuestions that require manual intervention will be graded very liberally. In other words those questions will not have as strict a grading criteria as in the GA portal.\nlakshaygarg654:\nIn\nGA4 Q10\n, very few students were able to solve the question using LLMs or Python during the assignment. Most of us ended up solving it manually.

Kindly verify these points before evaluation.\nQuestions Requiring Manual Intervention / Portal-Side Issue\nGA3 Q8\nIssue: The question doesn’t mention all required queries. Although all mentioned queries were added, the portal seems to check for additional queries not stated, resulting in an incorrect answer flag.\nGA3 Q9\nIssue: This question asks to create an LLM prompt, but upon submission, a pop-up requests the AIPROXY_TOKEN.\nClarification needed: How are we supposed to handle token-based inputs for evaluation?\nGA4 Q2 & Q10\nIssue: Previously encountered issues have been resolved.\nReference:\nGA4 Q2 and Q10 resolution\nOutput Formatting (Multiple Questions)\nIssue: When using plain text, the answer is accepted. However, in JSON format, newline characters (\\n) and backslashes are added.\nNote: As per the project requirement, the output should be in JSON like {“answer”: “result”}. But directly copy-pasting such a result with special characters leads to rejection by the portal.\nVercel / Docker Hub / Ngrok Deployment Questions\nIssue: Some deployment-related questions require a **live-running server, which needs real-time manual deployment using platforms like Vercel or Ngrok.\nClarification needed: How is this expected to be evaluated?\nDeployment-Related Issues (To Be Included in Thursday’s Session)\nPlease include discussion and solutions for the following deployment issues:\nPlatform Capability for GA Tasks\nWhich cloud platform (Azure, DigitalOcean, etc.) can handle all GA tasks reliably?\nNote: Some platforms have limitations that block certain tasks or token usage.\nFile Upload Example via Platform API\nRequest: Please provide examples for both small and large file uploads using API from a cloud-deployed app.\nThis would help validate deployments for assignment questions involving file input.\nGeneral Observations on GA1-5\nOutput Accuracy: Approximately 80% of the questions in GA1-5 return correct output when tested on a local machine. However, about 20% either have portal-side issues or deployment-related problems.\nKindly review these points before final evaluation, and let us know if any additional clarification is required from our side."

    "content": "@carlton\n,\n@Jivraj\n@Saransh_Saini\nGA2 - Question 3: Publish a Page Using GitHub Pages\nAs part of the requirement, I successfully published a webpage using GitHub Pages that includes my email address\n21f3001076@ds.study.iitm.ac.in\nin the HTML content. The page functions correctly and becomes accessible on my local system.\nTo automate the publishing process, I implemented a delay function that checks for the page’s availability after 5 seconds. Based on testing, GitHub Pages typically take around 10–20 seconds to go live after repository creation and HTML deployment. As a result, the complete process—from initiating the API call to verifying that the page is live—takes approximately 30 seconds locally. This setup works reliably on my local machine.\nHowever, when deploying the same process on Azure, I encountered an issue. Without the delay, the API responds too quickly—before the GitHub Pages site is actually live—resulting in a broken or non-functional link on the assignment portal. On the other hand, including the delay function causes Azure to throw a\n502 Bad Gateway\nerror, likely due to Azure’s request timeout limitations. The additional wait time slightly exceeds the platform’s allowed response duration.\nGA4 - Question 9: Process PDF Files\nA similar issue occurs in GA4 Question 9, where the task involves processing PDF files. While this works perfectly in the local environment, it leads to a\n502 Bad Gateway\nerror on Azure. This is due to the relatively long time required to parse and analyze the PDFs, which again exceeds Azure’s execution time limit.\nMoreover, pre-processing the PDF files is not an option because the input varies for each user. Therefore, the PDFs must be processed dynamically, which adds to the delay and contributes to the timeout problem.\nCurrently, I am using Azure for deployment, and for the majority of tasks, it works reliably. Although these specific tasks face timeout issues, shifting to another deployment platform is not feasible at this point. I am not certain if alternative platforms will work consistently across all questions, and making such a change could introduce failures in other parts of the assignment where Azure performs well.\nBelow Image is showing response of local machine api request for GA2 Q3 which works fine.\nimage\n1854×493 55.9 KB"

    "content": "@s.anand\n@carlton\n@Jivraj\n@Saransh_Saini\nFinal Thoughts on Project 2\nProject 2 has been a valuable yet challenging experience. I’d like to share a few reflections—not as criticism, but as constructive feedback with the intention to contribute positively to future iterations.\nOrganization & Structure:\nThe project felt a bit unstructured at times, which may be expected given that this is possibly the first time such an initiative is being carried out. I’m not blaming anyone—just sharing my thoughts. I hope positive insights can be drawn from this feedback.\nDeployment & Portal Limitations:\nThere are noticeable limitations on the deployment side (e.g., timeouts, platform constraints) and occasional issues on the assignment portal. While frustrating, these also led to some deep technical learning.\nTime Constraints:\nBalancing this project with ongoing coursework and other responsibilities has been quite demanding. The deadline of March 31st adds pressure, making it difficult to thoroughly test all 57 questions across different environments.\nSessions & Support:\nThe sessions conducted were helpful in addressing specific topics, but in many areas, I had to rely heavily on GPT and self-guided exploration to move forward.\nDeployment Variability:\nEach GA’s questions seemed to expose different limitations depending on the deployment platform. This inconsistency made it hard to predict which questions would work reliably.\nEffort Acknowledgment:\nI sincerely appreciate the efforts of the TAs and instructors—it’s clear that a lot of hard work went into enabling and supporting this project. However, it’s also a bit disappointing that we, as students, are unsure which questions are expected to work and which may fail—even the team might not have full visibility over this at the moment.\nFeasibility in the Given Timeline:\nEven for someone with a technical background, it’s difficult to troubleshoot and experiment across so many cases within the current timeline. Trying different approaches per question isn’t always feasible before the deadline.\nI genuinely hope someone is able to complete\nall 57 questions\nsuccessfully—I’d love to learn from their experience and solutions.\nAgain, this post is meant in a positive and constructive spirit. If anything I said seems inappropriate or off the mark, please let me know—I’m happy to edit or delete the post if needed.\nThank you for the learning opportunity"

    "content": "lakshaygarg654:\nGA4 - Question 9: Process PDF Files\nA similar issue occurs in GA4 Question 9, where the task involves processing PDF files. While this works perfectly in the local environment, it leads to a\n502 Bad Gateway\nerror on Azure. This is due to the relatively long time required to parse and analyze the PDFs, which again exceeds Azure’s execution time limit.\nMoreover, pre-processing the PDF files is not an option because the input varies for each user. Therefore, the PDFs must be processed dynamically, which adds to the delay and contributes to the timeout problem.\n@carlton\nI watched the last session. In that session, regarding the specific PDF question, you mentioned that the PDF is the same for everyone, so it can be preprocessed beforehand. However, I checked and found that the PDF is actually different for each user. So, we need to fetch it from the API endpoint.\nHow should we handle the timeout issue on the deployment platform? I even tried upgrading the plan, but it didn’t help.\n@s.anand\n@carlton\n@Jivraj\nAlso, many questions and doubts were addressed in the last two sessions. I can improve a lot and add the remaining questions, but the constraint is the 31st March deadline. Most students, including myself, will only get time after 30th March due to Viva and OPPE.\nIt would be really helpful if the TDS team could extend the deadline.\nI believe it would strike a good balance—team made us wait for the Project 1 results, but extending the Project 2 deadline would make up for that for some extent. Its request nothing else."

I have developed a mini chatbot backend using\nvicky_server.py\n, which handles question matching and execution internally, producing appropriate responses.\nMy mini chatbot is capable of creating its own API using REST and can manage tasks such as image compression, repository management, workflows, and web scraping related to graded assignments. It can even calculate total marks for subjects like physics and convert PDFs into markdown content. Additionally, it is capable of downloading the Llama model and creating a tunnel using ngrok. Essentially, it can address the first four assignment questions.\nHowever, there are some limitations to this project. Currently, it processes my local files instead of the uploaded PDFs. I am working on resolving this issue, but I have some confusion regarding the internal handling of uploaded files. When I pass a PDF or file through an upload method, how should the system proceed? I want to ensure that the file is treated as a PDF for the user rather than just being referenced as “question.pdf.” How can I effectively manage this problem?\nFurthermore, there is an issue with question matching. At times, the system incorrectly identifies questions containing the word “code” and executes\nfirst.py\nfor GA1.\nThank you for the opportunity to work on this project!\nBest regards,\nvicky kumar\n@s.anand\n@carlton\n@Saransh_Saini\nmy model at\nVicky kumar tds"

I request the timeout to be at least 40-60 seconds as yt-dlp and faster-whisper take take to download the audio, load the model and run it on cpu and get the transcription.\nFor 259.7 to 351.8 seconds, it is taking around 1.5 mins, but it is giving the correct answer.\nSo I request you to shorten the length of the audio or increase the request timeout or both in moderation.\nQuestion —> the “question” sent to the api will have the youtube video link, right? Or since the video is same for everyone, can I just have the audio file ready in the project? Will the api be tested against any YouTube video other than the Mystery Story Audiobook link given in the GA question?\nEdit: Even with a preprocessed audio file (mp3, speech optimized, 32K), what’s taking the longest time is joining the transcribed sentences into a single string. That alone is taking >50 seconds. Please suggest a way to make it faster.\nRegards,\nShivaditya"

Our teachers don’t have enough time to make a separate video for project to explain what to do and how to do? I already have done two project courses and they taught us, even they made 2 - groups just only for discussions in which one is personal and also made a YouTube playlist especially for project. They explained what should be your approach? How to make project? And here, they took only one session just only for show off. And they organised that single session when too many student requests too many times? Are we studying in IIT - The top institute of India or in a cheap and lower than third class government schools. It is the responsibility of our teachers to explain the project, but they are just showing off. Even they never provided the solutions for assignments also. Is it not our right to get solutions so that we can know where we did mistake? They don’t have time to make solutions, they just made an assignment checker which checks the assignments automatically. I don’t think so that they really made any effort in our course. In project-2 also, we need solutions for all graded assignments and so many students request for solutions but our the great teachers ignores the request and didn’t provide the solutions. I think they provide the projects whatever comes in their dreams during sleeping. In weekly study material, don’t have their notes, even they have a very few videos made by them, they just render to other YouTuber’s Youtube videos and online websites. Are we paid just only for these YouTube videos ? If we can understand everything just only from YouTube then why we are studying from the India’s top Engineering institute - The IIT Madras? I have much more better videos than that are provided on YouTube and created by other YouTubers. They only have some points copy pasted from documentations, but they never tried to explain them. Just read, copy and paste in your program. What is it, why it is used for, don’t ask anything.\nSome students request for extending the time limit of [roject-2 just only for one day, but what was their excuse- \"We won’t be able to extend deadline, if we do, then evaluations will get delayed. \". I want to ask them, where is the result of Project-1? The first date of result declaration was 26-Feb, then their another date was 16-March, but until now on 2-Apr, we do not get our results. It is more than 45 days, what is this going on? Nobody tried to ask with our great teachers. But on extending the deadline of project-2 just only for one day, their evaluation will be late. In project-2, we have to continue running our project until they will not evaluate, whether they take more than 1, 2 or more months. Either we have to host online by paying or run our own system for 24x7 unto when, we also don;t know as their result date is also not fixed, it is just a combination of letters and numbers showing on portal. It is our tales it is my right to get solutions for every weekly assignment, but don’t ask them to make efforts. Just pay and do assignments at own risk even you have not understand anything from the copy-pasted material. Just use AI’s or read whatever and wherever you want to read.\nIt is my kind request, our term is going to be completed, but please make some efforts in next term.\nThankyou to all my respected ‘The Great Teachers’."

    "content": "Dear Shahzada,\nYou joined Discourse almost a year ago Jun 8th, 2023. In all that time you have read 832 posts. And never interacted with anyone on discourse. You finally decided to interact once and that was today and this is your first post (your second if we count that you deleted your first post)\nThe first step to receiving help is communication. If you do not communicate, no one can help you.\n23f2002668:\nWhat is this going on? Is it joking?\nI am not sure what your question is. I am not sure what you are referring to. Please be clear in your questions.\n23f2002668:\nOur teachers don’t have enough time to make a separate video for project to explain what to do and how to do?\nWe have made\nseveral hours of videos\non Project 2 and have demonstrated multiple ways to solve it. However, we are not going to ever create it for you. We do teach you all the core technologies you can leverage to create it yourself.\n23f2002668:\nI already have done two project courses and they taught us, even they made 2 - groups just only for discussions in which one is personal and also made a YouTube playlist especially for project.\nNot sure which courses you are referring to, but those are standalone courses. Here project is part of the course and is meant to take you roughly a few days to create. We gave students more than one month for Project 1 and the solution for it takes a few hours to create. (which we have shared)\n23f2002668:\nThey explained what should be your approach? How to make project?\nYes these were explained if you\neither took part in any live session or\nwatched the recorded video\n23f2002668:\nAnd here, they took only one session just only for show off. And they organised that single session when too many student requests too many times?\nI am not sure what you are referring to because several sessions were conducted for Project 2 spanning nearly 2 weeks.\n23f2002668:\nIt is the responsibility of our teachers to explain the project, but they are just showing off.\nProject 2 was explained. I can summarise it in these words:\nCreate a server api that receives a request.\nThe request would be any question from the first 5 GAs.\nThe response has to be a json response as specified in the Project page.\nMultiple demonstrations were done of this workflow in sessions.\n23f2002668:\nEven they never provided the solutions for assignments also. Is it not our right to get solutions so that we can know where we did mistake?\nSince this is your first post, you’ve never ever asked for solutions to any assignments. We have never provided solution notebooks for TDS. It defeats the learning process.\nIf you want solutions, there are several options:\nAsk for help (since you have never posted before, you missed the opportunity to receive it)\nCollaborate with others (a bigger goal of TDS, because in the real world one man bands almost certainly fail with extremely high probability, barring a few exceptions, human progress is built on collaboration)\nJoin live sessions, where we have provided solutions to almost every assignment question that students have asked (and not asked)\nWatch the live sessions, we have even created neat Q & A summaries for them on the TDS portal (something which no other subject does at the moment)\n23f2002668:\nThey don’t have time to make solutions, they just made an assignment checker which checks the assignments automatically.\nThis is one of the most loved features by our students. No other GA in any other course gives you the option to check your answers in real time and better yet correct them before submitting.\nThe biggest clue for solutions is in this nugget. If you take the opportunity, and enterprise and get some fellow students together, you are actually able to obtain the solution script from the GA page itself. It takes some effort, but that is how learning occurs… with effort. Studies repeatedly show that zero effort results in nearly zero learning.\n23f2002668:\nAre we paid just only for these YouTube videos ? If we can understand everything just only from YouTube then why we are studying from the India’s top Engineering institute - The IIT Madras? I have much more better videos than that are provided on YouTube and created by other YouTubers.\nIf you had better resources available, you have hardly been the paragon of virtue, because we always encourage people to share their learnings. We learn from you, just as you learn from us. If someone makes a better video than us and give it for free, we are happy enough to learn from them. Why should we reinvent a video that is poor quality and force students to watch it when there are better videos? We are not so egoistic to take that approach and worse it does not benefit our students to satisfy our ego. There are a million videos out there on you Tube, how do you find the best one? We curate it. So that you do not have to spend hours finding a good video.\nBut feel free to find better videos. More power to you, but what would be even better? Share with others so that we can build each other up.\nWhat are the best videos to learn linear algebra? Probably MIT. Why bother with substandard videos when you can just get the best for free? Its just that watching MIT videos will not give you an undergraduate degree from MIT. And it costs Rs. 2.7 crores, provided you even get a seat in the first place. Here you get a 4 year degree for Rs 3.5 lakhs. So you are paying for that.\nI absolutely 100% agree with you, if you think you can get a better degree for Rs 3.5 Lakhs then definitely do that. There is no point in wasting time and money on something that is not delivering good value to you.\n23f2002668:\nThey only have some points copy pasted from documentations, but they never tried to explain them. Just read, copy and paste in your program. What is it, why it is used for, don’t ask anything.\nReading documentation is a skill you have to pick up.\nHaving said that, we have always explained something that students have asked.\nJust ask anyone who attended the sessions. More significantly, most of the new things we learnt, were self taught. Unless you pick up this lifelong habit, you will struggle in the real world.\nNow is a good time to start.\n23f2002668:\nSome students request for extending the time limit of [roject-2 just only for one day, but what was their excuse- \"We won’t be able to extend deadline, if we do, then evaluations will get delayed. \"\nThat is correct. We do not want to evaluations for Project 2 to be delayed as end term is very close. Is your complaint that you want evaluations to be delayed? Also its not an excuse. Its a fact. Delaying submissions, delays evaluations. Its just basic logic.\n23f2002668:\nI want to ask them, where is the result of Project-1?\nThey have already been sent to all those who passed the prerequisites. Yours did not pass the first time.\nLuckily for you,\nour first priority is always to do our best for students. So not being satisfied with the validation script that was run which was stricter, we created a new one that was more forgiving. You should get a 0 based on the stricter criteria, but you passed on our more lenient check and now you will soon be getting a normalised 7/20 score (we have not decided the normalisation yet because its a matter of deciding how lenient to be).\n23f2002668:\nThe first date of result declaration was 26-Feb, then their another date was 16-March, but until now on 2-Apr, we do not get our results. It is more than 45 days, what is this going on? Nobody tried to ask with our great teachers.\nIf you had attended the live session you would have seen Anand explain the reason for the delay. And we do not mind when students ask why and we freely tell them why. So I do not understand how you came to this conclusion.\n23f2002668:\nIn project-2, we have to continue running our project until they will not evaluate, whether they take more than 1, 2 or more months. Either we have to host online by paying or run our own system for 24x7 unto when, we also don;t know as their result date is also not fixed, it is just a combination of letters and numbers showing on portal.\nAnand invited students to write the evaluation script in his live session. And since you claim it is so easy you could have written it and gotten full marks. I am not sure why you did not take this easy option. You complained about it, but decided not to create a solution?\nAlso if you watched the sessions, we never asked you to run your server for 2 months or 1 month  etc. Its generally a bad idea to make assumptions that have no basis in reality. Project 2 is easy to evaluate. We expect it will take a few days, possibly by this weekend to finish evaluation and push a score. So why you came to the conclusion it would take months, is a mystery, given that you already rightfully explained that its easy to write a script.\nBut validation takes time. We want to make sure there are no bugs and errors and a lot of edges are possible when students are running various deployments. So we want to give them the best chance of actually scoring. Unless you prefer we do a rush job and give them zeros. You would have received a zero in your project 1 had we not caught a few edge cases in our testing regime.\nYou can take a poll and ask fellow students if they prefer your approach. We are always happy to make changes based on feedback.\n23f2002668:\nIt is my kind request, our term is going to be completed, but please make some efforts in next term.\nThankyou to all my respected ‘The Great Teachers’.\nI am glad you decided make a kind request, although by all the personal insults and attacks and your ending sign off its clear that neither\nrespect\nnor\nkindness\nis evident in your post.\nBut thank you for your feedback.\nOne final note: Do interact more, its healthy. We make mistakes, and we learn. There are many things we want fix for next term. Its not at all our desire to delay evaluations. The complexity of project 1 evaluations was unexpected. So we do apologise for that. We have done so repeatedly, even in our sessions and in discourse posts. The scripts that we released for everyone, probably showed how challenging it was to get it right so that everyone who could get a score, got a score.\nAnd when writing posts or emails or any communication, try to stay on point and professional. We are always happy to learn what we can change and improve.\nKind regards,\nTDS team"

    "content": "Hi, I have a few things to say\nMy background :\nI have completed all the courses in diploma except TDS. I have secured reasonably good grades in all the courses. However, I failed TDS the last term and I am likely to fail in this term too. The reason is, I got bad marks in both ROE and I have never submitted any project, i.e., I have not submitted 3 TDS projects in the last two terms and did badly in the first project of the previous term.\nMy Initial Disappointments with this Course\nIn one of the orientation session, I heard Andrew sir say this (subject to correction):\nThe video lectures are the primary content. It is not compulsory to attend the live sessions, but it is highly recommended.\nHere, the most important resource are the live sessions. I did not like it. Till now, I have managed all the courses with faculty lectures alone. I rarely watch live sessions. I didn’t like watching live sessions. I felt it was against what is pointed out in the previous paragraph\nROE is just for forty five minutes, with around 10 questions. I felt that this is rubbish and unthoughtful.\nThere are not many videos explaining the tools (from IIT side). Only a few videos. Most of the tools are explained through text. I felt that a the purpose of a college course is to explain things in a simple way so that we can learn it easily.\nWhy did I fail?\nLast Term\nI dumped myself with a 3 more courses, projects and nptel courses. I didn’t practice the GAs properly. So I failed ROE. I will come to the projects soon.\nThis term.\nI made sure that I do all the GAs properly. But I did better than last time in ROE but still bad. This time because, other than GAs, I didn’t allocate time for ROE. Also, I didn’t submit both the projects.\nIn both the terms I didn’t collaborate with anyone. I felt that I shouldn’t earn my marks be talking help from someone. I felt it is not fair.\nMe Understanding about the Course Now\nThis one line changed my view about ROE.\nOn another topic\nWhat does this RoE evaluate?\nImplicit learning.\nI am reasonably ok with python and all the tools in this course. But in ROE, I was not able to write a nested for loop, which was needed for some question. It is not that I don’t know how to write a simple nested loop. I discovered the fact that I have not coded enough.\nI scored 100 in all the OPPEs : python, java, PDSA, DBMS. I knew the concepts. But the questions were not difficult and the time was ample. This is not the case in TDS.\nNow I realize that  I am not good in SQL or DSA. It is just the questions were easy and was accompanied with ample time.\nIn MLP, I score just 40 in OPPE 1, this was because of me not practicing\nSKLearn\n. Then I practiced and got 90 in the second OPPE.\nThis course has made me realise that till I need to learn relearn these things in an\nimplicit\nway.\nThis is the exact reason why I have not been able to complete the projects. I still know most of the things required for project 1 and 2. But I was not able to practically sit and write the code.\nI have understood that this is not a traditional course. I feel that we must expect something different from this course. Especially not just marks\nI have understood that the limited amount of recorded lectures for is a way to make the students to practically go through the documentation. Understand the complex phrasing of some functionalities, etc.\nI am most likely to take this course again. I feel extremely bad to have wasted 15000 rupees. But this course has been a wake up call for me. I still feel that I have the potential to do this course way better than this. What I would have to do is a lot more coding of what I have already learnt.\nFrom the other project courses, I had a wrong assumption that projects are about applying what we have learnt. This was also a reason why I didn’t do my projects in TDS. I felt that the course team didn’t cover all the essentials of a projects. I have now realized that projects are about applying what we know and also learn new things which will enhance our projects.\nSince this is not a traditional course, I also feel that it is fine to collaborate and seek help, at the same time, strive to contribute to others too.\nThanks to\n@s.anand\n,\n@carlton\n,\n@Jivraj\nand\n@Saransh_Saini\nJust two suggestions\nI feel that MAD 2 and MLP should be corequisites.\nWhile introducing the projects, kindly include a video where the flow of the project is explained. Also, address few questions in the video itself which are likely to be asked by us."

    "content": ":\nFrom Problem to Platform: Building “Vicky” – A Smart Data Science Assistant for TDS @ IIT Madras\nProject Demo Website\n:\nhttps://app.algsoch.tech\nDuring our college course\nTool for Data Science (TDS)\nat\nIIT Madras\n, we were tasked with a challenging but exciting project:\nto build a platform that can take in natural language questions and execute corresponding solutions through an API\n.\nThe Mission:\nCreate a tool that behaves like a\nchatbot\n, accepts\nuser queries (text or file-based)\nvia\nweb or API\n, processes them intelligently,\nexecutes the appropriate code\n, and returns accurate results—like a real data science assistant.\nThe Journey: From Fails to Final\nAt first, the natural choice was to try\nLLM agents\n—they sounded magical. But in real-world usage, they were slow, unreliable, and lacked precision. Most failed to parse or execute even moderately dynamic queries.\nThen I thought—what if I manually mapped questions and answers using a\nstatic JSON structure\n? That quickly broke when users passed\ndifferent parameters, different files\n, or queried in\nnon-standard formats\nlike “code -s” or “code -v”.\nThe next idea: write\nindividual Python scripts per question\nfrom our Graded Assignments (GA1–GA5). But that lacked flexibility and reusability. Creating multiple files became unmanageable and non-scalable.\nThe Breakthrough: Dynamic Function Mapping\nAfter multiple iterations and failed prototypes, I finally found the right architecture:\nCentralized engine in\nvicky_server.py\nUses\nregex-based pattern matching\nto detect question types, extract parameters, and identify the correct solution\nEach solution is a structured Python function like\nga1_first_solution(query=None)\nSupports dynamic parameter injection, command-line variations, file-based queries, and more\nActs like a\nmini compiler for data science tools\nPresenting Vicky – The Mini Chatbot for TDS\nVicky is a\nsmart, modular chatbot\nbuilt specifically for\nTool for Data Science at IIT Madras\n. It’s packed with real functionality—not just templates.\nKey Features:\nGraded Assignment Solver\nHandles dynamic, real-world questions from GA1 to GA5 like:\ncode -s\n/\ncode -v\n→ VS terminal commands\nCreate FastAPI API for CSV with filtering/searching\nGitHub automation: repo creation, GitHub Actions setup\nData cleaning, scraping from IMDb, image compression\nFile Upload with Query Matching\nUsers can upload a file (CSV, JSON, Excel) and ask file-specific queries. The system understands context and dynamically links the query to the uploaded file.\nHTML Viewer + Base64 Decoder\nView any website in rendered & source format using CORS proxy\nUpload Base64 string → Get original image back\nWebhooks Integration\nLive notifications via\nDiscord\n&\nSlack\nwhenever\n/api\nendpoints are accessed\nMonitors\nserver status (online/offline)\nand sends real-time updates\nLLM Download + Auto Tunneling\nDownloads LLaMA models\nDynamically finds available ports\nCreates and exposes tunneled endpoints\nLive Web UI at\napp.algsoch.tech\nAsk any TDS question\nUpload and query with files\nImage decoder\nGraded assignment slider navigation\nHTML viewer\nAPI health status\nBuilt With:\nFastAPI\nfor blazing fast APIs\nRegex & Pattern Matching\nfor dynamic input detection\nGitHub Copilot\n+ my Python debugging and architectural thinking\nFull webhook and status monitoring system\nModular backend (\nvicky_server.py\n) and web frontend (\nvicky_app.py\n)\nI want to extend a huge thank you to\n@s.anand\nfor their guidance on this project. I’ve learned what prompt engineering is and how we can leverage large language models (LLMs). One interesting takeaway is that while these technologies won’t replace our jobs—especially for those who understand programming—they will create new job opportunities instead.\nNow I am capable of how fastapi work and more things and how to structure code and how to design code and most important what to think for project"

If not, is there any way we can show proof of our original submission? Currently, we have email confirmations for both the initial and the edited responses.\nWe hope this won’t be a major issue, especially not on the level of Project 1 concerns.

    "content": "@Saransh_Saini\nSir, I saw from the logs on Cloud Run that my project was probably evaluated on 5th April at around 11:51 PM and all the requests made during that time resulted in 3 response status codes: 302, 307 and 405 by no fault of my app, but rather errors in the request itself. I mentioned the exactly correct URL of my app in the form but the evaluation logs show three different types of URL to which request was made. As I mentioned in the form, my url is of the format “https://…/api/” and allows only POST requests.\nThe app was supposed to allow POST requests and I allowed only POST requests, so GET requests even to correct url resulted in 405 response\nWhen POST requests were actually made, two wrong urls were used for all the POST requests\na. http://…/api/ → resulted in 302 response\nb. https://…/api  → resulted in a 307\nwhereas the url I gave was of the format “https://…/api/”\nThe logs from Cloud Run\nimage\n982×552 133 KB\nAs you can see from the above logs, all POST requests made to my app have the wrong url, some have only http and some end with “/api” instead of “/api/”, both of which do not match with the correct url I gave in the Google Form (screenshot attached below).\nimage\n831×645 41.7 KB\nI request you to re-evaluate my project 2 with the correct url exactly as I had submitted in the Google Form.\nThank you.\nRegards,\nShivaditya"

And we retry them to give students the best chance of getting a score. Sometimes we accomodate some unusual situations that we have been made aware of but all of those interrupt our workflows and so it takes time. Which makes this process a little unpredictable.\nThis is the first term where we have had students deploy solutions that require significant compute resources on our end to evaluate. So there was always going to be hickups. But i think that we have delivered an equally enriching learning experience as a result which is enough to land you an actual job. (Might not be so enriching on your CGPA admittedly, but thats a small price to pay for invaluable skills you hopefully have gained)"

I came to know that many students have received an email stating that the re-evaluation for Project 2 will be conducted today between 11 PM and 2 AM. However, I have not received any such communication on my end.\nI would like to bring to your attention that I actively helped several peers deploy their servers on Vercel and resolve various issues, and many of them received marks as high as 80. Unfortunately, my own record still shows as “Absent,” despite the fact that I submitted the Google Form well before the deadline and my server has been live and running for over two weeks.\nFor your verification, I am attaching screenshots of my GitHub repository and the Vercel deployment dashboard, which clearly show the deployment.\nI sincerely request you to kindly consider this issue. This situation has caused significant mental stress, especially as I had already faced a grading issue in Project 1. The anxiety and uncertainty around my Project 2 score have negatively affected my focus during the end-term exam and viva for other projects as well. Receiving a zero in this project would only further impact my overall performance and morale, despite the genuine effort I have put in.\nI genuinely hope for a positive response and a fair re-evaluation.\nThank you very much for your time and understanding.\napi link :\nhttps://tds-proj2f.vercel.app/\ngit\n949×580 62.4 KB"

The API becomes accessible when using\npublic DNS services\nlike\nGoogle (8.8.8.8)\nor\nCloudflare (1.1.1.1)\n. This suggests that the current deployment environment may be using a restricted or unreliable DNS resolver, which causes access issues on some networks (e.g., Jio).\nSuggested Fix:\nTo ensure reliable access for all students, could you please consider updating the deployment or testing environment to use a\npublic DNS\nprovider?\nRecommended options:\nGoogle DNS\n:\n8.8.8.8\n,\n8.8.4.4\nCloudflare DNS\n:\n1.1.1.1\n,\n1.0.0.1\nThis can typically be configured via Docker settings or the environment’s networking configuration.\nAlternate Option:\nIf the DNS change isn’t possible at the moment, I kindly request that you evaluate my project using the\npreviously deployed endpoint\ninstead:\nhttps://tds-project-2-pnlm.onrender.com/api/\nPlease note that this endpoint may take\n50 to 60 seconds\nto respond, as it’s hosted on a platform with a cold start delay — but it is fully functional and provides the correct outputs.\nBoth endpoints are currently active and return identical results.\nThank you so much for your time and support — I truly appreciate the effort you’re putting into helping us succeed in this course!\nBest regards,\nSahil Raj"

    "content": "Hi Jivraj,\nI would like to draw attention to a specific question regarding the process of creating an HTML file and publishing it to GitHub. I notice that I am not providing a preloaded answer when this question arises. Instead, it creates a new repository and an HTML file, then deploys it on GitHub. Initially, it presents a URL, but I understand that your server checks to verify whether the URL contains valid HTML. This verification process takes time, which can lead to an incorrect response when checking the URL right after deployment.\nAt that moment, the URL might not display the HTML content or be verified by your server, even though eventually, the deployment is successful and the URL is correct. Please keep in mind that publishing to GitHub requires some time; it’s not feasible to expedite this process drastically, to my knowledge.\nI checked and noted that this question has been asked recently.\nAdditionally, I believe the image may show your server’s IP address.\nThank you!\n1000063856\n1920×858 139 KB"

Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)’”\n}\nWhat Was Expected:\nThe question required developing a script that:\nParses a large, deeply nested JSON log file, and\nCounts how many times a specific key — represented by XF — appears in the JSON structure.\nIt was explicitly stated that:\nOnly key matches for XF are to be counted, not values.\nThe file to be used was:\nE:\\data science tool\\GA5\\q-extract-nested-json-keys.json\nWhat I Did:\nI used the correct approach, parsing the nested JSON file and counting how many times the key XF appeared throughout the structure.\nHere’s the actual response I got using this cURL command:\ncurl -X POST\nhttps://app.algsoch.tech/api/\n\\\n-H “accept: application/json” \\\n-F “question=…How many times does XF appear as a key?” \\\n-F “file=@E:\\data science tool\\GA5\\q-extract-nested-json-keys.json”\nAPI Output:{“answer”:“14602”}\nThis indicates that my logic worked correctly and the key XF appeared 14,602 times, exactly as intended.\nWhat Went Wrong on API Side:\nThe API returned a parsing error, indicating:\n“invalid literal for int() with base 10: ‘Error: Invalid JSON in the file…’”\nHowever:\nMy file was valid JSON, properly parsed.\nThe actual issue seems to be on the API’s side — possibly mishandling the file read or decoding before passing it to the evaluator.\nIt may have expected an integer but received a string-wrapped error or non-integer data, causing it to crash.\nInsight:\nIf the original question was about counting the key XF, my solution was 100% correct.\nHowever, if the question dynamically changed the key name or added extra criteria (e.g., only count if value == true, or only under a certain section), then the result might differ. But from the default XF-focused question, my logic and result match perfectly."

Over the last few months, I’ve built a personal project called\n“Vicky App”\n— a smart assistant platform specifically designed to help students in courses like\nTDS,\n.\nThe system is capable of:\nAccurately solving over\n90% of assignment-style questions\nusing regex and phonetic matching\nDynamically executing the right code logic based on the student’s input\nProcessing uploaded files such as Excel, PDF, CSV, and JSON\nDelivering instant answers, completely independent of ChatGPT or any external LLM\nYou can test the platform here:\nhttps://app.algsoch.tech\nWhat’s in it for students:\nThey type their question, and the backend executes the correct solution automatically\nEspecially helpful for GA preparation, understanding problem logic, and reducing repetitive workload\nI’ve made it\nfree for the first 3 questions\nAfter that, students can access the full platform for just\n₹199/month\n, which helps me cover system maintenance and hosting costs\nMy Humble Request:\nThis is a tool I’ve built with immense effort and love for this course, and I genuinely believe it can benefit many students.\nTo sustain the platform — hosting, APIs, file management, and backend orchestration — I’ve introduced a small paid model after a free trial.\nI would be extremely grateful if you could test it once and, if you find it helpful, consider sharing it with upcoming students or mentioning it in a Moodle announcement.\nIt’s built\nby an IIT Madras student, for IIT Madras students\n— with the sole goal of making their learning smoother, faster, and smarter.\nThank you so much for your time and support.\nWarm regards,\nVicky Kumar\nB.S.

We had all planned our submissions based on the clearly communicated “best 4 out of 7” policy. This unexpected shift has raised concerns about transparency and fairness principles that should be central to academic assessment.

    "content": "I hope this message finds you well\n@jkmadathil\nsir.\nFirstly, I would like to sincerely apologize for any misunderstandings that may have arisen. I have the utmost respect for the grading system and for the esteemed professors at IITM, and I deeply value the effort put into the course.\nHowever, as a student, I am hoping to clarify the criteria for earning bonus marks in the TDS course.\nAddressing the queries you raised in your post:\nWhat is the policy related to bonus for Diploma level courses as per grading policy document?\nIn previous modules, such as Project 1, bonus marks were awarded for completing additional tasks (1 bonus mark per task if the code handled them correctly). Similarly, in GA4, bonus marks were given for replying in Discourse. These bonus marks, however, were specific to the respective modules and did not affect the final grading.\nWhat is the policy adopted in previous instances of TDS?\nI am not fully aware of the policies adopted in previous terms for the TDS course.\nDid anyone read the text related to bonus marks associated with GA7?\nI have read the email regarding GA7 and the associated bonus marks. The email states that:\nDear Learner,\nDEADLINE: 10th April, 2025 23:59:59pm\nGA7 requires you to submit 3 peer evaluations, so that you may be graded for your submission.\nPlease find the form link below to submit your evaluations.\nhttps://forms.gle/DhBW4xdKyv7hXhXD9\nAFTER completing your initial 3 peer reviews which were sent in the previous email,\nif you submit 5 additional reviews, you will be awarded upto 5 BONUS MARKS to your final T score. For example if your final TDS score is 75, doing all 5 extra peer reviews can boost your final score in TDS to 80.\nYou will have to submit the form 5 times (1 for each peer). Use the same form link to submit 5 different reviews. Your Bonus score will still be based on the metrics derived for the initial 3 peer reviews, but scaled for 5 peer reviews.\nYou have been given the peer submissions as links to HTML files which you have to download and view in a browser.\nDoes anyone know what should be done to get the bonus?\nFrom the information in the email, I infer that students who complete the additional reviews are eligible for bonus marks, which will be added to their overall total marks.\nHas anyone inquired about effort involved in getting the bonus?\nMy peers and I have worked diligently to complete all required tasks, including the ROE and projects. Earning additional bonus marks is certainly a challenging milestone, and we understand that it requires considerable effort.\nAfter answering all the above, has someone actually tried to follow instructions in the “mail” to get the bonus?\nUnfortunately, I can’t follow the instructions because I did not receive the email about submitting extra peer reviews, as it appears to have been sent to those who participated in GA7.\n…\nGiven this context, I would appreciate it if you could kindly clarify the situation for students who completed all GAs from 1 to 6 (or did their best 4 GAs) but did not participate in GA7. Specifically, I would like to understand why only those who completed GA7 are receiving the bonus marks email regarding peer reviews.\nPlease note that I ask this purely for clarification and with the utmost respect for the professors and the grading system, as I have no intention of creating controversy. I simply wish to understand the criteria.\nThank you for your time and consideration\n@jkmadathil\nsir.\nBest regards,\nAkshit Mittal"

    "content": "Yes\n@jkmadathil\nsir, I did receive this email from one of my peers, although we are not closely acquainted, making it difficult to complete a review with the peer who shared the email.\nSince the beginning of the course, it has been emphasized that the\nTDS course focuses more on teamwork\nand collaborative learning than individual study. I fully believe this concept and worked together with my group. I created Colab files for 4 GAs for my peers(more than 250 peers must have benefited from it), and\nmy peers supported me with Project 1 and 2.\nThey were mainly responsible for helping me score the full marks in the first two minutes of the ROE\nrelease and we had a meeting after ROE, which was scheduled with you.\nI understand that earning bonus marks for GA7 will be difficult. However, I had no opportunity to participate in this process even after submitting six GAs, while attempting only GA7 (which I understand presents a slim chance) may grant me 5 bonus marks. I acknowledge that the chances are difficult, but many of my peers who didn’t submit GA7, including myself, feel we deserve an opportunity.\nSir, I am not questioning the grading system but I think it would have been helpful if we had known earlier that peer reviews in GA7 would be part of earning bonus marks. In GA4, Anand Sir made it clear that anyone who asked or answered a question in the GA4 discussion would receive bonus marks but these were specific to GA4 (e.g., a score of 110 out of 100), not the overall grading.\nTo be clear, my query is why I am not being afforded the opportunity. I believe there may have been some confusion or lack of clear communication regarding the bonus system. I am not pointing out mistakes, but I just feel the information about the bonus could have been shared more clearly.\nFinally, I want to thank everyone with whom I have connected during this course. I am not questioning why others who submitted GA7 are eligible for a bonus, but I am simply asking why I am not eligible, especially after submitting six GAs, the ROE, and two projects. I know that the world is much more than 5 marks, but I am only seeking clarity on the situation.\nI’d also like to mention that with the end-term exams just three days away, most of us will be focusing on preparing for them. However, I trust you’ll definitely take our concerns into consideration, and we remain hopeful for clarity regarding the bonus marks.\nThank you once again for your understanding."

    "content": "It is good to see that you have been actively collaborating with your peers and both have benefitted from this. Here is the main query that most people are having:\n23f2004636:\nTo be clear, my query is why I am not being afforded the opportunity. I believe there may have been some confusion or lack of clear communication regarding the bonus system.\nHere is my response, and I have consulted with the course instructors before sharing this:\nEvery term in TDS, both instructors and students are not aware of what bonuses are going to be given out at the start of term. Bonus activities are created at any point, at the discretion of the course team, and the information is not disseminated in a wide fashion. It’s primarily a reward mechanic for those that really are interested in engaging in the whole breadth of the course. For instance, in the last two terms the bonus activities required them to post their solutions in Discourse where the problem statement.\nThe course team do not invent GAs for the sake of giving opportunities for scoring marks. They are opportunities to learn and put that learning to use. Another goal is for the GAs to be opportunities to learn by collaborating with each other.\n192 students took that opportunity to engage with GA7. If no one is interested in doing the GA, then why should the team take the effort to create it? Would you rather prefer that we make it mandatory for all students to do all GAs (by making GAA = average of all GA Scores)? Some courses do that. We were very lenient in our GA scoring because the course is tough. Students benefitted from that leniency. Should we reverse our leniency so that everyone “gets the opportunity to get bonus marks?” Think about this\nAs a course team, they did not know beforehand that they were going to give opportunities for any bonuses when GA 7 was created. So there was no information to give. Please do understand that the course team do not knowingly hide things from students (that’s a viewpoint that some students seem to suggest with their posts or at least).\nWhen we saw that some students were taking the effort to do GA7, we decided that we would give them an opportunity as a reward for their diligence, to try and obtain some bonus marks. Are you jealous of their diligence?\nIt is extraordinary that it appears you would prefer if those students, who actually put in the effort, would not be given the opportunity! You have not been able to avail the opportunity because you decided that doing GA 7 is not worth the effort at all. They thought it was worth the effort\nbefore\nthere was any chance of a bonus. And now you begrudge them that reward for their own diligence.\nOnce again reiterating this point - Bonus marks are given for activities to students at the discretion of the course team. It always has been. And it has never been widely available to all students in past terms of TDS either. This term is no exception. They are never decided beforehand. They are created as and when there seems to be an appropriate opportunity to reward students for their effort.\nThe 192 students that decided to do GA7 deservedly have that opportunity. But it’s not guaranteed for them either. They have to put in a significant coordinated effort with their peers to actually achieve that. In other words, it’s not a freebie.\nI had promised to provide the distribution of people who did GA7 both in terms of number of assignments done and average score in GAA. Here is the data below:\n# Assignments Done\n# students\n0\n42\n1\n33\n2\n22\n3\n19\n4\n23\n5\n28\nAssignment_Score\n# students\n0-10\n75\n11-20\n19\n21-30\n15\n31-40\n9\n41-50\n13\n51-60\n7\n61-70\n11\n71-80\n12\n81-90\n10\n91-100\n17"

I just have one sincere doubt:\nAs you mentioned, the intention behind the GA7 bonus is to reward extra effort in GAs—but why are 5 bonus marks being added to the\ntotal course marks\n, instead of awarding\n15/100 of the total\nto those who did GA7 exceptionally well?\nStudents like me, who have consistently scored 100% in all GAs (excluding GA7) and have been actively participating in the Discourse forum from the beginning, seem to be left out. Don’t we deserve some recognition for our consistent efforts too?\nIt’s not about jealousy—it’s about acknowledging those who have put in their day and night from the start, completing every GA diligently and earning bonus marks as per the criteria already defined for earlier GAs.\nI’m only concerned about\nmy own marks\n, and I just wish for a fair system that values consistent effort across the term.\nThank you for your time and understanding.\n@carlton\n@Jivraj"

I completely understand that bonus marks are at the discretion of the course team and are meant to reward diligence and deeper engagement — which is fair.\nHowever, I just want to point out a potential nuance: Many of the 192 students who did GA7 may have done so\nnot\nfor extra learning but simply to ensure their top 4 GAs included 4 full scores (e.g., to replace a lower-scoring GA). So the distinction between diligence-for-learning and diligence-for-grade-maximizing becomes blurred.\nNow that bonus marks are announced\nafter\nthe deadline, those who already had 4 perfect scores and skipped GA7 based on the stated structure (top 4 out of 7) are essentially penalized for playing the game by the original rules — not for a lack of diligence or engagement.\nI’m not questioning the bonus system itself, just pointing out that such surprises can unintentionally favor certain strategies over others — and more transparency around this in future terms might help students make better-informed decisions without second-guessing themselves later."

    "content": "Sir, why is GA7 given the atmost priority and the bonus of GA7 is not awarded to GA7 alone but is awarded as bonus to the entire total score of the course.\nIf the team wants to award the bonus marks for the consistent performance then they should consider the best 5 or 6 GAs and award bonus accordingly. It is unfair that those who just attempted GA7 are been given bonus marks to the entire course. If you wish to provide bonus marks then provide the bonus marks for GA7 alone, the same way as it was done for GA4.\nThe main issue is that the bonus marks concept was never informed prior. The team should not take actions at random as it would affect many students. As per grading document, only best 4 out of 7 GAs were supposed to be considered. Even if the team wishes to give the bonus mark then it should be given to the GA7 alone and not entire total score.\nSir as per the current logic, say a person just attends GA7 alone and doesnt attend any another thing then he would also be awarded bonus 5 marks to his total score just because of the fact that they\nattended\nGA7. Whereas students who have been submitting Ga1 to 6 and werent able to submit GA7 alone as per current logic are not being considered for the bonus mark. This is unfair.\nPlease think from our side.\nRegards\nKarthik"

Since many students, including myself, scored well in our best 4 assignments, which were prioritized as we aimed to maximize our grades, we did not attempt GA7. The bonus marks for GA7 were announced after the deadline, which has led to a concern that this may create an imbalance in the overall grading.\nFor students who excelled in their top 4 assignments, the additional 5 marks from GA7 may not significantly alter their overall grade, as they have already demonstrated strong performance. Conversely, those who struggled initially and attempted GA7 in hopes of improving their grade may benefit more from this bonus. This could inadvertently disadvantage those of us who strategically focused on the highest scoring opportunities available to us.\nGiven that the bonus marks were introduced after grades were finalized, I respectfully ask if there’s a possibility to consider an adjustment in these"

The assumption that those who did not attempt GA7 chose not to put in effort is not accurate, respectfully.\njkmadathil:\nYou have not been able to avail the opportunity because you decided that doing GA 7 is not worth the effort at all.\nI would like to point out that many of us, myself included, showed consistent diligence by completing and submitting GA1 through GA6.\nPersonally, I solved GA5 and GA6 even after solving my Best 4 GAs purely for the learning experience\n, knowing they wouldn’t necessarily impact my grade directly. I never avoided GA7 out of carelessness—I simply prioritized the fact that only the best 4 GA scores would count. This is not a lack of effort or interest in the subject matter.\nFurther, you mentioned:\njkmadathil:\nThe 192 students that decided to do GA7 deservedly have that opportunity.\nI completely respect the effort put in by those students.\nHowever, I would like to offer another perspective: what if some among those 192 had not completed their best 4 GAs prior to GA7? Meanwhile, those of us who consistently completed all previous GAs(excluding GA7) from the start are now excluded from this opportunity—not due to lack of interest, but due to lack of communication.\nIf the bonus is truly a recognition of effort\nspecific to GA7\n, then it might be more fair to reflect that in the\nGA7 score\nonly, not in the\noverall course total\n, which affects students who were consistently involved across the term.\nI know I’m still learning and have a long way to go—there’s so much about the world, professionalism, and fairness that I hope to understand better through experiences and guidance of professors and through the exposure from the college. But I also believe that seeking clarity is part of that learning.\nThank you once again for reading my message and considering my point of view."

    "content": "Thank you for the response sir, however my doubt was regarding a different issue.\nIt is not that I am jealous of their diligence or anything, its simply that even from the data you provided above, it seems that a majority of students, 141 out of the 192 students have not actually even done 4 assignments. So they might have done GA7 for the 4 GAA criteria, not just due to diligence. Once again I am not stating that they were all like that, but rather it is a possibility.\nAnother issue is that a lot of students might have originally worked hard on earlier assignments to score well but may not have had the time for later assignments such as college students like myself who have end term examinations ongoing currently. Since I saw that I had already put in the effort to do all 6 assignments prior, I only did not do the GA7 since it clashed with my examinations.\nOnce again I am not blaming the instructors for this situation sir but the bonus 5 marks can very well change which grade we get in the end, which is the reason why I have created this message. The students who have attempted GA7 do deserve extra marks for their work but if others were informed of the extra 5 marks then we may have also taken part in it, even if we had other prior commitments.\nThank you once again for reading this message sir and kindly consider our point of view."

    "content": "@jkmadathil\n@carlton\n@s.anand\n@Jivraj\nSir, as said in this another students’ post, i would also like to bring your notice to the fact that most of those 192 students who attempted the GA7 have not done 4 assignments. This shows their “diligence” which you are awarding them for. Whereas the students like us who have been submitting all the projects and the assignments GA1 to 6, how can the team conclude that just because we didnt submit GA7 we are not diligent enough to be awarded the bonus marks.\nShouldnt the bonus marks be awarded to those students who have been submitting literally all 2 projects and 6 assignments(6/7 i.e 85% of the assignments)? How could the team decide to award bonus 5 marks to the overall score just to those students based on a single assignment( namely GA7).  We are genuinely struggling, and we are requesting bonus marks based on that. Please don’t misunderstand our request as jealousy — it comes from a place of hardship.\nHow can a student who submitted 1 assignment make him more diligent than those who have been submitting 2 projects and 6 assignments. I think if you plan to award bonus marks you should consider best 5 or 6 assignments and not just based on a single assignment.\nJust because we didnt submit a assignment(GA7) why are we being deprived of the bonus marks which was not even informed of. If you want to provide the bonus marks then you can also consider the best 4 assignments as well as it would also show the students’ interest and diligence as you said. If you want to consider for the bonus marks you can consider any assignment right, why just GA7 is the question. You can also award the bonus marks based of GA-1 or GA-2 or so. I think the diligence which are talking of, should be measured based on consistent performance and not just based on a single assignment.\nRegards\nKarthik"

    "content": "Hi everyone,\nA bit of data might be useful. Its been interesting reading all your posts, I thought I might share some brief insights.\nFirstly students\nvastly\noverestimate the ease of getting bonus marks in TDS.\nSo of the approx 200 students that did GA7: The top bonus mark was 3.\nOnly 2 students managed it.\nGoing by that statistic, of the 600 students who are active in TDS, possibly 6\nmight\nhave even managed to get 3 or more marks.\nSo lets not pretend that this was easy by any stretch of the imagination.\nThe mean bonus score was 1.27.\nSo, on average, you would get less than a 1/3rd GAs worth of marks for the extra effort of an entire GA+extra work. The psychology study it revealed however is interesting on this thread to see. The difference between perception and reality. My advice is stop reacting emotionally and evaluate rationally.\nThat is the data for you.\nStudent Bonus\n600×371 7.62 KB\nAlso noteworthy\nBonus marks in TDS are never made known ahead of time for any term in the past and neither will it be in the future.\nNone of us knew that there were going to be bonuses after the submission of GA7. Please stop requesting, “at least you should let us know before GA7”. How can we let you know, if we ourselves were not aware there were going to be bonus marks?\nBonuses are always surprise opportunities that are\nnot\nwidely available to everyone. For example we never release them on the seek portal. In the past Anand has released them on discourse, where typically, in previous terms, less than a fraction of a third of the students are even engaged, let alone active. Of course students in the past complained saying, they did not know and were not informed. To which the response was, maybe you should be more actively engaged on discourse. How many people typically tried TDS bonus in the past? Probably around 50. So compared to previous terms, this term is a huge improvement!\nBonuses are not a right.\nThey are opportunities that become available for those that are engaged with the course. Where and when that opportunity becomes available varies. A bit like real life.\nHowever we have read all your concerns and we have decided to put a disclaimer in the grading document for future terms:\nOpportunities for bonus marks might become available for activities linked to any of the GAs, Projects or Course Modules. The may be revealed at anytime, on any platform (seek, discourse, course site) and through any medium (official email, discourse) at the discretion of the course team. Bonus marks are not guaranteed and are awarded at the discretion of the course team."

While 2–3 of the worksheets were publicly accessible, many remained private despite the ample time provided. This raises the possibility that the individual assigned to grade those particular sheets—aside from myself—may also not have had access, potentially affecting the overall grading accuracy.\nAdditionally, I noticed that some worksheets were largely incomplete or just a single sheet was provided, and there is a chance that a few participants may have copy-pasted their own values because the if the sheet were provide and access wasn’t given, the probability of the correct values being there was really high, which could further influence the evaluations. Admittedly there were quite a lot of empty sheets too which I gave zero as deserved but this might not have been the case with other evaluators.\nGiven these factors, I wanted to kindly request clarification on how these were handled. Was there a specific threshold required to qualify for the bonus, and how are such inconsistencies accounted\nSir, some of us(including me) have submitted all 7 GAs and despite the end term we approached peers and completed all 8 reviews even when we had already got 90-110 in first four with average being 100 so I hope we could be graded fairly and appropriately for our efforts."

The  course’s rules  seems to be changed on a whim, which is pretty unfair to those of us who completed the first 6 assignments properly. If anything, why not inform the +5 bonus before declaring the GA-7. “Rewarding diligence” is a vague point as completing 6 out of 7 assignments requires a decent commitment to the course. Getting rewarded for completing all 7 assignments is something absolutely commendable, without a doubt but getting a +5 on the basis of simply GA-7 is vague because it doesn’t guarantee the commitment towards the other 6 assignments. A person who has completed 6 assignments, skipping GA 7 is less diligent than someone who completed 4 assignments including GA7 is the summary I am gathering : )\nPlease correct me if I am wrong"

You can also active your GitHub student developer pack and get 180 hours of GitHub codespaces and some more benefits such as cloud resources and domains.\nI have done all questions of week1 and week2 on codespaces only, codespaces works very well if you have good internet connection."

    "content": "Hi\n@carlton\nand\n@Jivraj\nsir,\nI appeared for the end term examination held on 13th April 2025 during the FN shift. I would like to bring to your attention that the exam interface did not provide an option for multiple selections. However, a few questions appeared to have multiple correct answers.\nI have noted down the specific questions and the corresponding options I believe to be correct.So, kindly review them and let me know if there were any errors in my understanding of the questions. The questions are as follows:\n1000042547\n1080×578 187 KB\nQuestion 2: Fields needed to filter “POST requests under /images/ from 15:00 to 18:00 on Mondays”\nTo filter such logs, we need:\nTime → for the hour and the day (Monday)\nMethod → to filter POST\nURL → to filter /images/\nSo, the correct minimal set is:\nTime, Method, URL\nTime → needed\nMethod → needed\nURL → needed\nReferer → not needed, but not harmful\nSo this option includes all the necessary fields, just with one extra — which doesn’t invalidate it.\n1000042548\n1080×301 71.5 KB\nAcc to solutions only option 6406534159827 is valid:\nStatus is numeric (200)\nMethod (GET), Protocol (HTTP/1.1), and URL (/index.html) are correct\nAll required fields are present and properly formatted\nThe other options were as follows:\n9825 uses invalid protocol (INVALID)\n9826 uses invalid status code (OK instead of numeric)\n9824 has no critical issue — it is technically also valid (only uses a private IP 192.168.1.1, which is unusual but not invalid). So both 9824 and 9827 are valid, but the answer marked only 9827\n1000042545\n1079×468 35.7 KB\nCorrect Answer(s):\nPUT – Correct: It replaces the resource entirely. Multiple identical PUTs = same result.\nGET – Also correct: It only fetches data, no side-effects. Multiple GETs = same result.\nDELETE – Technically correct: Deleting the same resource multiple times has the same result as deleting once (resource stays deleted).\nIncorrect Answer:\nPOST – Not idempotent. Each POST usually creates a new resource or changes server state.\n(This is the mistake on my part that I put the ans as POST as I thought since 3/4 are idempotent and one is not I should select the odd one out but I hope this could be resolved)\nThank you"

In that case\nlen(filtered entries)\nseems to be correct. However the right answer is marked ‘None of these’ .\nimage\n1108×394 81.9 KB\nThe valid log entry had me stumped too, option 1 and 4 both look absolutely fine yet only option 4 is marked correct.\nAlso, only POST request is not idempotent, all other requests are idempotent yet only PUT is marked correct.\nRequest you to please clarify and consider these points."

    "content": "Thank you for the clarification provided regarding Question 4 and resolution of errors in other questions. I understand the reasoning behind choosing Option A (Time, Request, Method, URL). However, I respectfully believe Option C (Time, Method, URL, Referer) is more accurate for the following reasons:\nRedundancy in Option A:\nThe Request field already contains the HTTP method, URL, and protocol (e.g., “POST /images/logo.png HTTP/1.1”). Including both Request and separate Method and URL fields introduces redundancy. If we already extract Method and URL separately for filtering, the full Request field becomes unnecessary.\nSimplicity in Filtering:\nFiltering for “POST requests under /images/” from 15:00 to 18:00 on Mondays can be done using:\nTime → for checking the hour and weekday.\nMethod → to filter only POST.\nURL → to ensure the request is under /images/.\nThus, Option C (Time, Method, URL, Referer) already includes all needed fields. While Referer is not essential, it doesn’t interfere with the filtering and might be useful in future extended filtering cases (e.g., source tracking). Therefore, Option C is complete and accurate without being redundant.\nConsistency with Log Parsing Practices:\nIn most log analysis scripts or systems (e.g., Python’s re or pandas parsing of logs), Method and URL are parsed from Request for separate use. This further supports the idea that including Request alongside Method and URL is not best practice."

    "content": "QUESTION 9\nI was supposed to transcribe the audio of the provided video for a certain time period. After several attempts my submission still generated differences from the supposed answers. I have tried all forms of re-punctuations but the error wont budge. I even compared the generated transcript with the actual audio several times. I BELIEVE MY ANSWER IS CORRECT. If not I wish to know what the correct answer is. Because compared to the video I have provided the exact and well punctuated transcription of the audio between 397.2 and 505.5 seconds.\nHere was my transcription - \" Determined to confront the mystery, Miranda followed the elusive figure. In the dim corridor, fleeting glimpses of determination and hidden sorrow emerged, challenging her assumptions of friends and foes alike. The pursuit led her to a narrow, winding passage beneath the chapel. In the oppressive darkness, the air grew cold and heavy, and every echo of her footsteps seemed to whisper warnings of secrets best left undisturbed.\nIn a subterranean chamber, the shadow finally halted. The figure’s voice emerged from the gloom, “You are close to the truth, but be warned some secrets, once uncovered, can never be buried again.”\nThe mysterious stranger introduced himself as Victor, a former confidant of Edmund. His words painted a tale of coercion and betrayal—a network of hidden alliances that had forced Edmond into an impossible choice.\nVictor detailed clandestine meetings, cryptic codes, and a secret society that manipulated fate from behind the scenes. Miranda listened, each revelation tightening the knots of suspicion around her mind.\nFrom within his warm coat, Victor produced a faded journal brimming with names, dates, and enigmatic symbols. Its contents mirrored Edmund’s diary, strengthening the case for a conspiracy rooted in treachery. The journal hinted at a hidden hall beneath the manor, where the secret society stored evidence of their manipulations.\nMiranda’s pulse quickened at the thought of unmasking those responsible for decades of deceit. Returning to the manor’s main hall, Miranda retraced her steps with renewed resolve. Every shadow in the corridor now seemed charged with meaning, each creak of wood a prelude to further revelations. In the manor’s basement, beneath a concealed panel, Miranda discovered another revelation \""

On the same day, I intended to delete my post on Discourse but couldn’t find it, as it was still in draft mode. So, I deleted it. However, I was surprised to see the post today.\nI regret any inconvenience caused."

Thats why we need students to look through the logs and identify issues so that we can make sure you get the correct evaluation.\nIf students notify us their image is actually arm based, then we will run it on arm. So dont worry, just inform us of any discrepancy as well as bugs. Our evaluation might not be perfect, there may be bugs. If students can precisely create bug reports then we can take that into consideration when evaluating students as well. The benefit being you might get extra marks because of the bug fix.\nWe have a script that looks at this discourse post each day and tells us who requires a fresh evaluation.

Running on your local machine is not a sufficient criteria for passing the evaluation. It is absolutely vital for students to understand deployment. This is a critical skill for anyone who is serious about working in this field.\nAlso just check if yours is an arm based image or x86. Sometimes that makes a difference. For us there is no way to know other than docker software telling us. As it turns out several students had an arm based image but docker did not tell us that. So we will re run those.\nIf yours has been run on the wrong emulation then we will re run.\nKind regards"

Also, kindly pardon me for the long message.\nI have received a MISSING statement in my evaluation log file in the project 1 score mail that was released yesterday.\nThese are the detailed point wise concerns :\nI at the earlier stages, found the Tools in Data Science course relatively challenging as it’s just my second term in Diploma and I have only completed BDM and MLF Course till now. Hence, I decided to drop the course in February, however when I could still view the course on the portal, and raised concerns, the assistance provided to me was very grim and low, and after numerous follow-ups, I was finally informed 2½ weeks after dropping my course, that my drop application was received in draft and they would not proceed with it, and I had to continue my course.\nBy this time, I had already missed 2 graded assignment deadlines and the project 1 submission was due in the coming 2 days. Not losing my spirit and with whatever I could learn and implement I completed the TDS project 1. However, I accidentally attached the wrong docker image link, and I also raised the issue, but didn’t receive a reply.\nI understand that it was a fault on my part, but evaluating a student as 0, even though all their functions are right, and they give the required answers, is also wrong since we are expected to provide correct answers, and learn to build the docker image, however, there can be occurrences where a student might make a small mistake like uploading the wrong link, and they must be given a small chance to reprimand them.\nI also didn’t receive the mail from the TDS Team which they issued for students whose docker image or GitHub link was erroneous, and hence I realised after the deadline that I had uploaded the wrong docker image link.\nI have rechecked all my function, and they are all correct, giving a 0 to a student, who worked hard within the limited available time(given the student had dropped the course but the course team didn’t process it) is very unfair.\nKindly provide me a way to either re-upload my project-1 Docker image link, or ask them to provide me marks on the basis of the functions and codes written, whichever is feasible, atleast to encourage the efforts and time put into the project with little knowledge.\nI hope you would look into my plight, and take necessary measures.\nThanks and Regards"

During evaluation, a binary incompatibility between\npandas\nand\nnumpy\ncaused the container to fail. To my surprise, the same versions (\npandas==2.0.3\nand\nnumpy==1.24.3\n) were working fine while developing on my local machine. I also tested it with the same Dockerfile on both Linux and Windows platforms using these versions, and it was functioning correctly before pushing and submitting it. I checked the other day after pulling the Docker image from Docker Hub following the submission, and it worked at that time as well.\nTo resolve this issue, I adjusted the Dockerfile to explicitly fix these versions, rebuilt the container, and conducted further testing locally. The application now correctly initializes on port 8000 and returns expected responses within the required 5-minute timeframe.\nI’ve pushed the updated image to Docker Hub (\nsantoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest\n). Could you please ensure that the latest version of my image is pulled from Docker Hub before rerunning the evaluation?

If you alter the dockerhub image, our image will no longer match the one from dockerhub. the image id sha will change. So do not worry about whether your sha matches our sha.

    "content": "@Jivraj\n@Carlton\nI completely understand that changes to the Docker image after the deadline cannot be accepted.\nHowever, there are specific cases like mine where the Project 1 submission successfully passed the sanity checks on Feb 15 and received a decent score when the evaluation results were released on Mar 29.\nimage\n1272×395 25.7 KB\nBut here’s the catch:** Since the problem statement for Project 1 and Project 2 is nearly the same, I took the opportunity to improve upon my Project 1 and use it as the foundation for my Project 2 submission, which I did by:*\nImplementing a ReAct-based workflow planning & orchestration agent, inspired by the paper\nReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models\n.\nImplementing various tools for web-serping, web-scraping, read-eval-print-loops interpreters for quick calculations, etc.\nEnhancing Shell-use & Python-use by improving upon the existing code interpreter I had implemented for P1. This allowed the agent to dynamically generate and execute code without hardcoding anything.\nAdding useful API endpoints, including an\n/api/\nmultipart/form endpoint, alongside the existing\n/read\nand\n/run\nendpoints from Project 1, plus a\n/clear\nendpoint to reset the agent’s conversation memory if the context window gets saturated.\nDeploying the entire project on a paid GCP VM Instance with a static IP\n, utilizing my own OpenAI API key while keeping OpenAI’s API as a fallback in case AIPROXY ever gave up.\nAll this hard work evolved my project into something far beyond a simple Tool-Calling Agent—it essentially became a ReAct Principles based Computer-Using Agent capable of executing complex, non-linear workflows entirely within a container. And I’m not exaggerating: You could ask it to perform something like\nhyperparameter tuning for a Random Forest Classifier, offloading the results locally on a JSON file and displaying its contents\n, and it would do that for you—without\never\ndeclining the request. I like to think of it as a\nterminal version of\nOpenAI’s Computer-Using Agent\n.\nGiven all the effort, time, and money that went into this, it’s incredibly discouraging to see my project\nnaturally fail a sanity check (Docker image digest mismatch) (because of the aforesaid updates)\nand not get evaluated as a result. This is not the kind of experience that encourages students to learn, experiment, and innovate.\nTo clarify,\nall the updates mentioned above took place after March 29\n,\nafter Project 1 had already been evaluated, and results had been handed out.\nFurthermore, we were\nnever informed\nthat a reevaluation would take place on April 1. Had I known, I would have ensured that my original submission remained unchanged and considered creating a duplicate of my Docker image and implementing all the aforementioned enhancements on it.\nMy only request is that if my\nupdated P1 submission cannot be evaluated\ndue to the changes made after March 29 (before the P1 reevaluation on April 1), I would really appreciate it if my\noriginal P1 eval score could be reinstated\ninstead of receiving a\n0\n—since it was already evaluated and graded.\nWould highly appreciate your prompt support in this regard\n@carlton\n@Jivraj"

The reason being, any Docker image being built from a github repo is never going to look for the file sitting inside a directory. All build requirements have to be at root (this is not just for Docker, but also any other type of application build). Since root is where the core files to build an application always reside, again this is standard industry practise.\nIn our meeting we advocated for a lenient approach to search for Dockerfile inside the github and it was vetoed by\n@s.anand\nSo unless you can give a convincing argument why we should change our evaluation script and re run it for everyone again, (because that is effectively what we would have to do to make it fair to everyone), we will not be able to evaluate your docker image.\nKind regards,\nTDS team"

That’s why I carefully ensured that all the necessary files and links were correctly uploaded yet I received a 0 Score.\nI am not the only one facing this issue; several others have encountered the same problem. I kindly request you to review my submission again.\nAdditionally, I have faced multiple technical issues in recent times. Initially, I was failed in the L1 viva due to a typing mistake, which was later acknowledged. Similarly, in both OPPE 1 and OPPE 2, many students experienced Google Meet issues. On March 29, during my SC OPPE, I faced camera issues in Google Meet, along with VM lagging. Many students have raised similar concerns with Proctor.\nGiven this track record of technical problems, I strongly believe this could be another error in evaluation. I sincerely request you to re-evaluate my submission.\nScreenshot 2025-04-01 020618\n1335×667 57.9 KB"

I personally know a\nvery\nexperienced senior engineer at a top defense contractor for the US, here is some pearls of wisdom from him.\nWhat you have done is what is called in industry as\ngold plating\n. Its a cardinal sin in software engineering. NEVER gold plate. ALWAYS build to spec.\nIn fact its a good reason to fire an engineer. Why?\nBecause it does not deliver what was required,\nWastes valuable time and resources\nIncreases technical debt (this is actually a huge cost over the expected lifetime of the project!)\nComplicates testing\nLeads to scope creep\nHis advice to me was simple: NEVER gold plate.\nI hope you take this pearl of wisdom in your career. It will help you advance and make you stand out.\nFor personal hobbies this does not apply. But for a client (including us) if you fail to deliver the minimum spec then we cannot grant you an evaluation (by the way this post is not targetted specifically for you, it just felt like an appropriate place to explain this).\nKindest regards"

    "content": "Thanks for the clarification regarding the evaluation,\n@carlton\n. It’s a relief to know that my original submission was successfully evaluated. Had I known that the stricter evaluation script would pull the image matching the digest from the time of submission (which had been overwritten by April 1), I would’ve used a separate tag to avoid the issue altogether.\nRegarding your point on gold plating — I completely understand and have come to appreciate the importance of building to spec from personal experience, especially in production or client-facing settings where fixed targets, maintainability, and minimal scope creep are key. That said, with TDS projects, my goal was purely exploratory — to explore the boundaries of what’s possible\nwithin the scope of the problem statement\n.\nWhat began as just another (pun intended)\ntedious\nassignment slowly evolved into a hobbyist research project on LLM agents.\n(…caution: long post ahead\n)\nI noticed that\ntest cases in Project 1 and 2 were highly specific and often overlapping on Python & Shell use\n. While it would’ve been easy to hardcode 50+ Python functions to pass these cases (which, frankly, many of us were doing), it is non-scalable at best. I quickly realized that stochastic parrots + hardcoded functions were a recipe for disaster, especially considering the\ninherent randomness in LLM-generated payloads\n. No two payloads are exactly alike — even minor differences, like an absolute vs relative file path, or some hidden edge case could cause a hardcoded solution to fail unpredictably. There’s also really no way to predict an edge case caused by an LLM.\nSome might suggest using\ntemperature=0\nto get more deterministic LLM behavior — and while true to an extent, it does little to encourage exploration, especially in tasks that require self-correction based on environmental feedback. Prompt engineering too wouldn’t be helpful here as 4o-mini isn’t all that great at 0-shot instruction following, especially when the system prompt is already saturated with 50+ fine-grained instructions. There’s only so much stuff it can pay attention to.\nHardcoded tool agents also aren’t really “agents” in my view— they’re more like passive AI powered regex matchers\n: merely mapping inputs to functions by inferring from context window. That puts all the burden of answering on the hardcoded functions, leaving the agent itself uninvolved in the solutioning process. If they break, the agent will never try to ‘fix’ them and keep calling them like a broken record.\nAt the core of it, it’s all about\nhow much flexibility vs rigidity\nwe give to the agent. Fully rigid solutions (e.g. hardcoding) overfit and break easily; fully flexible ones (e.g. pure LLM based) hallucinate or drift off-target. The sweet spot lies somewhere in between — The right solution would naturally balance the lesser of two evils in an ideal ratio.\nSince most LLMs already excel at code generation and structured solutioning, the most effective strategy that I figured out for the agent was to,\nReason about the task, understand intent,\nReflect, whether this problem is solvable using available tools without human intervention and design structured workflows, in whatever order appropriate (i.e.\ndesign\na DAG, where each node can be a python step or a shell step or something else)\nExecute those workflows (\nwalk\nthe DAG) observing the feedback at each step and reiterating if needed.\nObserve the final result, and repeat if needed.\nInterestingly, a similar framework was suggested in\nthis ICLR 2022 paper\n. That was all the validation I needed to know I was stepping in the right direction.\nTo make environment interaction possible, the agent didn’t need dozens of narrow tools — just a small, well-defined set of\ngeneral-purpose tools\n:\nA REPL executor (for quick calcs)\nA Python script runner\nA Shell executor\nWith just these, it could handle most tasks flexibly and naturally — avoiding overengineering while still enabling powerful behaviors. Potentially allowing for full fledged Computer-Use via shell and so much more.\nAs for the fact that it ended up being capable of things beyond the scope of Project 1 (like training & tuning ML models autonomously, reporting results etc.) — that was\nemergent behavior\n, not deliberate gold plating. It was a pleasant surprise even to me. I’ve yet to discover more of such interesting hidden use cases. While some might naturally call it scope creeping (and yes that is true, given that we had a deadline, and a play-pretend client-business relationship with the course team), I saw it as an opportunity for exploration and research.\nFrankly, I AM personally very keen about researching stuff!\nI am actually very thankful to the TDS course team &\n@s.anand\nfor devising such a thoughtful project that sparked some interesting ideas that I can tinker with.\nFood for thought! Really!\nAs for my next project, I now have a fair idea of what I’ll be experimenting with— modalities.\nPS: I’m not claiming it’s perfect or production-ready, or it should score a perfect 22/20, but it aligned well with what I believe was the spirit of these projects:\nthoughtful use of LLMs in agent design\n. At this point, I’m less concerned about the marks, I’m actually enjoying the thought joyride.\nTL;DR\nMy approach doesn’t rely on regex or hardcoded mappings. Instead, it passes user input directly to an LLM, which then plans and executes workflows using general tools inside a containerized environment. It also learns from feedback and iterates — much like a human. The fact that it can do more than just the minimum spec is a byproduct of that framework. I’ve only just wired the pieces together.\nKind regards"

These versions worked perfectly during development on my local machine and were tested multiple times across both Linux and Windows platforms before submission. Even after pulling the submitted Docker image from Docker Hub post-submission, it worked without any issues locally.\nHowever, during your evaluation, this incompatibility caused the container to fail.\nI acknowledge this issue, have fixed it in my updated submission, and previously conveyed this in my earlier message.\nAction Taken\nTo address this issue, I made a small adjustment to my requirements.txt file to explicitly fix these versions for compatibility across all environments. This was the only change made to my submission. After rebuilding the container with this updated file, I tested it again thoroughly in your replicated test environment, and it worked as expected:\nThe application initializes correctly on port 8000 within 5 minutes.\nIt responds to requests within the required timeframe.\nI have pushed this updated image to Docker Hub under the same repository:\nDocker Hub URL: santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest\nRequest for Re-Evaluation\nI kindly request that you pull the latest version of my Docker image from Docker Hub and re-run the evaluation process. I understand that deployability is being tested, and I have taken every necessary step to ensure that my submission now works in any environment, including replicating your test setup exactly.\nPrevious Message for Reference\nFor your convenience, here is my earlier message explaining this issue in detail:\n\"Greetings, Sir,\nI would like to bring to your notice a problem with my original submission of the Docker container. During evaluation, a binary incompatibility between pandas and numpy caused the container to fail. To my surprise, the same versions (pandas==2.0.3 and numpy==1.24.3) were working fine while developing on my local machine. I also tested it with the same Dockerfile on both Linux and Windows platforms using these versions, and it was functioning correctly before pushing and submitting it. I checked the other day after pulling the Docker image from Docker Hub following the submission, and it worked at that time as well.\nTo resolve this issue, I adjusted the Dockerfile to explicitly fix these versions, rebuilt the container, and conducted further testing locally. The application now correctly initializes on port 8000 and returns expected responses within the required 5-minute timeframe.\nI’ve pushed the updated image to Docker Hub (santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest). Could you please ensure that the latest version of my image is pulled from Docker Hub before rerunning the evaluation? I appreciate your time and effort in reviewing my submission again.\nThank you for your assistance!\""

We discussed all these scenarios in our weekly meets, and it was decided that we cannot make allowances for these because there was ample time to test your deployments and also ample sessions were conducted to address any difficulties you might have faced. A basic minimum standard was expected and we are unable to relax that threshold because then it would make evaluations meaningless.\nWe are not just evaluating on your agent functions. We require deployability as a minimum target. If you solution was not deployable and functional then we cannot evaluate the functioning of your application. Once again I sympathise with what might seem minor errors. But they are not minor, even though it may only be a line that needs changing or a spelling mistake. They actually cause a critical failure.\nA minor mistake is a function not working that does not prevent other things from working.\nCritical failures prevents everything else from working\nand thus most of these what seems like minor failures are missclassified. They are in fact critical failures.\nI know its not of much comfort right now, but the learnings from this will be important going forward in your career.\nKindest regards"

I wanted to humbly request a reconsideration regarding the evaluation of my project submission.\nI understand there was an issue with building the Docker image from the repository. However, I had successfully built and pushed the Docker image earlier, and I believe it demonstrates that my solution is deployable. If the final evaluation was solely based on building from the repository, I’m a bit confused about why the Docker image was considered earlier and why we were also asked to upload it to Docker Hub if it wasn’t going to be taken into account later. Also the earlier evaluation score where we got some marks at least and now are hopes are crushed after one night.\nI do realize that in the real world, these kinds of errors can be critical, and I truly appreciate that the course is structured to prepare us for such expectations. That said, this course has been quite challenging, and for many students—including myself—it has been a source of considerable stress and demotivation.\nI sincerely request that you kindly consider awarding some partial marks for the working Docker image that was built and pushed earlier. It does reflect an understanding of deployable solutions, which I’ve worked hard to demonstrate.\nI know you all have our best interests in mind, and I’m grateful for the efforts put into making this a rigorous and enriching course. My only concern is that such harsh penalties—especially for a single oversight—can significantly affect our CGPA and future opportunities. I hope my request can be considered with empathy.\nThank you for your time and understanding."

However, during the subsequent evaluation, the image was rebuilt using my GitHub repo link, and unfortunately, the\napp.py\nfile could not be found. As a result, my evaluation logs are missing from the evaluation logs bundle.\nI would like to respectfully bring this to your kind attention that the\napp.py\nfile does exist in the repository, but it is located inside a subfolder:\nhttps://github.com/wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent/app/app.py\n.\nBut as per the submission instructions, I provided the GitHub repo link only:\nhttps://github.com/wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent\n.\nHumbly stating, I did not anticipate that the image will be rebuilt from the GitHub repo at a later stage due to some unforeseen circumstances. Had I known this, I would have made sure the project repo was structured appropriately to support that scenario. To be noted, that the earlier evaluation ran smoothly, and the app responded to all queries as expected.\nI’m unsure what to expect now or request, but I just wanted to bring this issue to your notice. Even if I manage to get a single answer correct upon a successful evaluation, it would mean a lot to me and contribute meaningfully to my overall score. I would be extremely grateful if you could look into my case and extend your support in this matter.\nThank You and Regards,\n24ds3000090"

Could that be an issue?

Upon reviewing my GitHub repository, I realized that the file was named\ndockerfile\n(with a lowercase ‘d’) in the Github root repo instead of the required\nDockerfile\n(with an uppercase ‘D’).\nWhile the contents of the file were correct and my project passed several evaluation tests, I understand that the evaluation script could not detect the Dockerfile due to this naming issue. I genuinely did not intend to deviate from the standard, and I now fully understand the importance of following naming conventions precisely.\nI humbly request you to kindly consider this as an honest mistake and allow a one-time exception, Please sir. This issue has unfortunately resulted in my project score being reduced to 0, which puts my overall course performance at risk. I assure you that I have learned from this experience and such an error will not occur again in the future.\nSo, I hope you will look at this and re-evaluate my project as I put lots of efforts to complete it.\nThank you very much for your time and consideration.\nWarm regards,\nS.

    "content": "Hi Hari,\nThe goal of the course was never to go deep into specific technologies, with perhaps the exception of LLMs as major tooling capability for data science. Due to the volume of the content in the first 3 weeks it was decided to at least get students sufficient information to be able to do the Graded Assignments. One of the criticisms we received last term was that the sessions were too slow because we were covering from the very basics. So it was a conscious decision to speed up and shorten the explanations. Of course this is always difficult to get right because we respond to students in sessions. This is why attending the sessions is more valuable than watching the sessions. We cannot effectively gauge what level to pitch at if the audience is silent or not involved. We can only guess the level of the vast silent mass of students. The quality of sessions only improve when the sessions are interactive and well attended.\nHave you watched this session in particular?\nIf thats insufficient for you last term we did a 2hr 48 min session on just introducing it\nfollowed by another 2 hour detailed explanation of the more advanced use cases\nBut of course does everyone want to watch 5.5 hours of sessions to understand it? That depends on the student.\nUltimately the best you can get out of sessions is by actually attending them because only then can we address gaps in understanding.\nKind regards"

It uses Github (an online platform), it uses Vercel (an online platform) and thats it. I have a macbook air and it works fine for GA2 - Q6. Since the code you are running has no such dependency on your local machine it should not have problems.\nNow typical problems for example Q6 (and other questions) might involve the use of CORS. So for example the url might work in your browser when you access the vercel deployment url directly, but when using it via the GA, the request triggers a CORS error, because a third party application is requesting rather than you directly.\nAlso the live sessions on\nyoutube\nwill address some of these deployment related issues that students are facing.\nThere will be session\n2025-01-20T14:30:00Z\n→\n2025-01-20T16:30:00Z\nwhich will be recorded that will address any concerns on how to use these technologies and libraries.\nThe session is in your course calendar and the meet link is\nmeet.google.com/baz-ayij-ziy\nKind regards"

    "content": "@23F300327\nTypically for a vercel application, and in particular for GA2-Q6, the applications are basically function calls. You are not expected to setup and run a local http server as you are doing in your code.\nWhen a call is made to the endpoint which in this scenario is /api\nwith parameters, only one function is required, i.e the function that handles the get request.\nThe rest is also automagically handled by vercel. There might be a conflict between vercel’s webserver deployment and the one you explicitly have encoded in your program.\nThat’s why if you see in the course content about vercel, the simplest API service that you can launch with vercel looks something like this\n# api/index.py\nimport json\nfrom http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler\n\nclass handler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):\n    def do_GET(self):\n        self.send_response(200)\n        self.send_header('Content-type','application/json')\n        self.send_header(\"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\", \"*\")\n        self.end_headers()\n        self.wfile.write(json.dumps({\"message\": \"Hello!\"}).encode('utf-8'))\n        return\nNotice there is no\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\ncode block.\nThis would instruct the interpreter that this is the starting point of your module. Clearly we do not want that, we want vercel to handle all the backend server stuff because vercel might be running some preflight code before it runs your application.\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\nis used to execute some code\nonly\nif the file was run directly, and not imported. In vercel, it might not be the starting point of the application.\nTry rewriting it with just the required endpoint function inside the default\nhandler\nclass. Avoid custom named classes until you can get a working prototype working using the boilerplate that has been shared.\nAnother possible problem:\nBy default, the JSON module encodes Unicode objects (such as str and Unicode) into the \\u escape sequence when generating JSON data. The GA however is expecting a serialised  UTF-8 JSON response instead. These might look the same on the screen but are not equivalent at the bytecode level. These encoding problems were covered in one of the videos that talked about encoding issues\nTDS > Development Tools > unicode\nSo converting your output to UTF-8 might fix it.\nLet us know what worked. We are all learning from each other.\nKind regards"

    "content": "@23f1002382\nNothing unethical about using codespaces and public ports. You solved it. Thats what TDS is about. Solutions. How you achieved is not very relevant. There is more than one way to skin a cat.\nThat being said, it good to find multiple ways to solve a problem, because a single method may not work everytime. Like for example in an ROE. You have no time and you got to be able to on the fly try different approaches, if one way does not work. Also purely from the point of view of being a “scientist”, its fun to be able to solve the question of how do you get a locally running server available on the web to a client. So in that sense, I understand the “spirit of your question”.\nMost of the issues that most people face has to do with limited understanding of how applications and networks communicate. These are first and foremost apps that leverage various aspects of network communication. There are entire courses that deal with that subject, we want you to at least understand the basics. In that regard we have not actually provided you sufficient materials to get to grips with that. It is something we ought to address, but then students complain about having to learn too many things. Yet these are basic essentials!\nSo we are trying to get the balance right. For the most part many just muddle their way through it (like most of us I suspect), but some structured understanding of how these communications happen are probably worth their weight in gold for any aspiring data scientist because you then do not have to get IT nannies to deploy something quickly and you will wow your bosses as the guy/gal who just gets it done.\nIn the meanwhile:\nThere are other great videos on the above channel, but these are probably the most relevant for us. Modern applications also leverage the same concept by using ports to talk to each other and provide services. These then have to be made visible to the outside world using some routing tables, but there are software that does this automagically. But sometimes when things break, understanding why its not working will go a long way towards helping you find the solution. And a fix might be as simple as an entry on a firewall or on a routing table (a one line CLI fix). And everyone thinks you are a genius, when in actual fact you just know a little bit more about the underlying architecture that glues everything.\nKind regards"

    "content": "Hi Srividya,\nThats right the idea behind vercel is you do not need to create a server. Its serverless! Instead you create functions that respond to endpoints.\nWhen the endpoint is triggered, the appropriate function runs.\nThis renders\nname == main\npart of the code unnecessary at best, since python interpreters only run this line if that file was the starting point of the application (but its not, because a vercel wrapper application(s) or processes have started before it).\nIn other words you do not create a flask server, or a http server or indeed any server at all. Just functions tied to specific endpoints. So you have to rethink how your application is designed. You\ndo not\ncreate serverless applications in the same traditional way you have been taught in MAD-1 or MAD-2.\nThis is a common mistake many students have been making with their approach to vercel. Watching the videos and using the provided code template will greatly help in deploying successful serverless applications.\nThanks for your input.\nKind regards"

When I revisited the GA2 again, the question 10 was marked incorrect.\nDo I need to do anything else ?\nSecondly the image comression file needs to be reloaded everytime I reconnect to the GA2. When I reload the last saved version, it does not take into the answer already saved.\nThird, the url link as given on publishing the page via github is obviously correct. But on checking, even after ?v = 1 …it does not work. Could you kindly look into them and advise if anything else needs to be done at my end? thanks & regards."

I tried to use the OpenAI API, but I am getting the error as “The Maximum Quota has reached”. I tried using 5 new API Keys from OpenAI, from 5 different accounts. So, I had to use SentenceTransformers, Alibaba gte model. So, as the model has changed, I think so it is expecting answer as got from OpenAI Model, but as I used Alibaba gte model, I am getting different result. Can you please explain how to solve this issue? This will be helpful in my future codes. I could do chat requests but it is not giving output for Embedding requests, I tried it multiple times with multiple different keys.Thank You"

None of us can know everything — and that’s okay. We all have different strengths, and when we work together, especially on projects, those strengths really start to shine.\nI’ve come to believe that collaboration isn’t just about dividing tasks, it’s about learning from each other, supporting one another, and finding smarter ways to solve problems as a team. It helps us get things done more effectively and on time, and honestly, it makes the whole learning process a lot more enjoyable.\nThis course is definitely helping me build that mindset, and I’m excited to keep growing through shared learning.\nif somebody feels the same  then Reply , Thankyou"

And also if i just for example for testing submit solution of 1 question now then my score would get reduced from 7.25 to the marks of that 1 question i submitted right?"

    "content": "Hi Vikram,\nThis is because (if you watched the session, or examined the code, you would have realised that) datagen.py was designed to run inside your docker container. And datagen.py (or a similar named file which we will not tell you ahead of time and will be provided as the query parameter in task A1) will normally be called by evaluate.py\nInside the docker container, permission for the data folder is set by the Dockerfile\nwhich then allows your application to access the root folder inside your docker image and create the /data folder.\nSo the workflow is like this (for your internal testing only… please follow the Project page for deliverables and evaluation to submit project successfully):\nYou create your application server that serves 2 endpoints on localhost:8000\nYou create a docker image that runs this application server.\nYou run the docker image using podman as described in the project page.\nFor mimicking the testing conditions. You need two files:\nevaluate.py and datagen.py to be in the same folder where you are running these two scripts.\nRun evalute.py using uv.\nIf your docker image is correctly configured and your application is correctly configured, then all the tasks run by evaluate.py will correctly tell you if the application is producing the right result for each task.\nHope that gives clarity.\nKind regards"

    "content": "Is it considered best practice to create a virtual environment rather than installing packages globally, especially when working on projects that require multiple libraries? I understand that in a professional setting, we often work on multiple projects simultaneously, and developing the habit of using virtual environments now can help reinforce this practice for future projects.\nAdditionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file? My understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation. However, I have encountered instances where a specific version failed to install, requiring me to modify the requirements.txt file and remove the version constraint. In such cases, wouldn’t installing directly via pip be more practical?\nThat said, I also recognize that different projects may have unique dependency requirements. I’d appreciate your insights on best practices for managing dependencies efficiently."

    "content": "Yes, using a virtual environment is definitely considered best practice when working on Python projects. This approach helps avoid dependency conflicts between projects and ensures a consistent development environment. The main reasons why you should use virtual environments:\nIsolation\n– Each project has its own set of dependencies, preventing conflicts with other projects.\nReproducibility\n– A virtual environment ensures that all contributors work with the same dependencies.\nPortability\n– You can share a project with others (or deploy it) without worrying about system-wide package versions interfering.\nInstalling with pip individually (pip install package-name)\n• Good for quick experimentation and testing.\n• Not ideal for long-term project management because dependencies might update and break compatibility over time.\nUsing requirements.txt\n• Best for\nreproducibility\nand\ncollaboration\nsince others can install the exact same dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.\n• Avoids issues where one developer uses an updated library that breaks compatibility with another developer’s setup.\nSpecifying Versions in requirements.txt\n• If you\ndon’t specify a version\n, pip install -r requirements.txt will install the latest available versions, which might introduce unexpected breaking changes.\n• If you\ndo specify a version (package==1.2.3)\n, you ensure consistency but may run into problems if that version becomes unavailable or has compatibility issues.\nHandling Version Conflicts\n• If a package version fails to install, try removing the strict version constraint and reinstall.\n• Instead of completely omitting version numbers, consider:\n• Using\ngreater than/less than constraints\n: package>=1.2,<2.0 (allows updates but avoids major version changes).\n• Running pip freeze > requirements.txt after confirming a stable environment.\nBest Practices Summary\nAlways use a virtual environment (e.g., venv or conda).\nUse a\nrequirements.txt\nfile for reproducibility.\nPin versions cautiously—avoid unnecessary strict versioning unless needed.\nPeriodically review and update dependencies to prevent using outdated or insecure packages.\nKind regards"

    "content": "For some projects where there are many dependencies, like an ML project or flask app, it’s better you mantain a virtual environment since the dependencies are interconnected with their versions.\nWhereas for some simple projects, with less dependencies, global installation is fine.\nFor project that is to be deployed, make sure you use the virtual environment, only then you can ensure what worked for you also works on the deployement\n24f2006531:\nAdditionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file?\nComing to your second question,\nThe first time you install a fresh dependency, use direct and latest version. But if you are cloning or thinking of sharing the repo or using someone’s project it’s better to use requirements.txt.\n24f2006531:\nMy understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation\nThe creation of requirements.txt ensures that the current installation version is listed.\nNever try to list requirements.txt.

    "content": "@23f2003413\nWe will have it uploaded sometime this morning.\nIt has two parts to it. The first part is the TAs solving the Mock in real time (however this is not a solutions session). The purpose of it is to get you to realise some key things:\nThe chaos of ROE.\nThe adrenaline, speed of thought, the need to be very familiar with your tools.\nThe limited time you have to use GPT effectively. It will help you with minor work flows, but not with complex tasks. (watch the session debrief to hear a clear articulation about this).\nThe value of efficient and effective collaboration. A hodgepodge of many people will not make an effective solutions team.\nThe ABSOLUTE importance of creating your own cheat sheet with code snippets that will help you solve ROE quickly\nWorkflow of ROE: Data Extraction → Data Cleaning → Data Transformation → Data Analyisis → Information to answer questions\nThe pitfalls of getting fixated on a question (a very common mistake and you can see it happen in the real time solving session as well).\nHow limited the time is.\nThe second part of the session was a debrief for the sheer shock that students felt. The goal of the mock was to acclimatise you to the shock of ROE.\nPast terms never had this benefit. We thought to take the shock factor out so that you can be better prepared than any term before. Emotions were raw. But this is normal. What is unusual is to have a preview of it before ROE. So the discussions were very intense even for us.\nToday’s Mock ROE will be more like a traditional solving session and deal with new aspects. It has the added bonus of being hosted on an exam server (without a time limit).\nI would still STRONGLY advise setting a horrible sounding alarm to acclimatise to the pressure cooker of ROE. You will make stupid mistakes under pressure. The TAs did yesterday as well. So best to reduce this factor by getting used to the clock.\nKind regards"

    "content": "Respected\n@s.anand\n,\n@Jivraj\n,\n@carlton\nBased on the ROE mock assessments, I kindly request you to consider extending the allotted time for the ROE. Some tasks require downloading libraries, whereas you may already have these libraries or other necessary setups in place, which naturally reduces your solving time.\nAs you are aware, additional time will only benefit those who have prepared and possess the required knowledge. Students without preparation will not gain any advantage simply due to an extension. Furthermore, as the course has been modified from the previous term and many aspects are still being refined, we have already requested measures to support our performance and ensure our grades are not put at undue risk.\nI genuinely prioritize knowledge over marks and have put in significant effort to excel in this course. However, I do not want to risk failing. My goal is simply to meet  the passing criteria (at least 40 marks) . Therefore, I sincerely request you to consider granting additional time for the ROE as a reasonable relief.\nYour understanding and support in this matter would be greatly appreciated.\nBest Regards,\nLakshay"

    "content": "Hi Andrew,\nYou have done a great job with the Phase A tasks. Very methodical, well structured, logical and even incorporates (unnecessarily) two different ways of evaluating its performance via local llm or the project proxy.\nI just want to forewarn you (and others who are tempted to just blindly copy and paste) that evaluate.py is not meant to give you an exact expectation of what prompts will be sent to your application.\nIn other words getting 10/10 in\nevaluate.py\ndoes NOT guarantee 10/10 or even 5/10  or 1/10 in the real evaluation.\nSo do not write your code so rigidly that it will only work in the very strict interpretation of\nevaluate.py\n. It has always been meant to give you a feel for what to aim for. Your code should be flexible enough to deal with the general\nidea\nof the task.\nThat said,\nevaluate.py\nis a good way to know what to expect. Some of Phase A tasks although given a detailed specification in the project description, will still be given challenging prompts (i.e. hard difficulty, and requires some clever self correcting mechanism). Some of the tasks will be given straight forward prompt (i.e. easy for your application).  Some of the tasks will be given with some level of parameterisation that deviates from the strict interpretation (i.e. medium difficulty).\nHope that helps with how you deal with Phase B tasks (and making your Phase A more robust to a stronger evaluation.)\nA word of caution:\n(i.e. this is just some advice, not a set in stone recommendation)\nYour requirements.txt is massive. If your code does not execute a task (\npossibly your first task\n) within 20 seconds (on our server) then it will fail that task. You might want to consider a dynamic, flexible way of installing only required libraries when necessary and keeping the image footprint small and efficient, as we will necessarily have limits on how big we allow images to grow since we have to run and evaluate hundreds of images automatically.\nKind regards"

Hence executing code Interpreter tools failed as the model gave outdated code. I have raised this issue before\nHence i moved to function calling, using local llms as cost-effective solution and it was quite robust.\nI just need to understand how the function should be general, maybe 2-3 tasks you could provide the general description along with all the ways one would query the agent llm(ie our project). This general function is what i need help with. Please kindly do the needful."

Raising it for you means raising it for everyone. $1 for everyone equals raising it by $1600+\n(i.e Rs 1.39 Lakhs)\nfor us!\nThe budget question then involves more than one person. It also involves the BS Team Operations and not just the TDS team and therefore instead of responding with a response that is not useful, we typically try to solve the problem first and then respond.\nIn short we are working on it. But as we have mentioned repeatedly in our sessions, use APIs efficiently, thats part of the skill. As soon as we have a resolution we will inform everyone via an announcement and an email.\nKind regards"

It usually happens due to manual intervention with pip3 the user might break some system dependencies which require some python3 package. No need to worry about it.\nAnother Fix: try using a virtual environment which is highly suggested since there is no chance for you to interfere with the system packages.\ncreate a venv using python3 -m venv name_of_venv\nadd this line to your .bashrc in ~ folder as source /path/to/your/venv/location\nand run source .bashrc. This time no error occurs as you do everything in your virtual environment you can install anything python3 package using pip3 install package name.\nIt even happened for me\nScreenshot_20250215_143357\n3841×1009 237 KB"

I was able to develop an application using this approach; however, due to submission time constraints, I could not verify all tasks (my bad). While I tested some tasks and found the results to be highly accurate, I was unable to validate everything thoroughly.\nTherefore, I submitted the function-calling approach (Method 2) instead.\nI sincerely appreciate everyone’s guidance and support."

When I checked the authenticity of the link, it showed an error, even though the GitHub repository link is functioning perfectly.\nI have poured my heart and soul into this project, dedicating countless hours and sleepless nights to ensure its success. The project has successfully passed both Test A and Test B, and I was thrilled to see my hard work paying off. However, this single error has left me devastated.\nI am pleading with you, with all my heart, to allow me to correct this mistake by updating the Docker image link. Alternatively, I humbly request that my application be reviewed directly through GitHub. Please consider this an exception, as I have worked tirelessly over the past two weeks to create an application that is 890 lines long.\nI beg for your understanding and leniency in this matter. This project means the world to me, and I am genuinely sobbing over this setback.\nThank you for considering my heartfelt request.\nSincerely,\nRishit Jain\n(24F2004595)"

I am writing to highlight several issues and doubts related to different aspects of the course that require clarification and resolution.\n1. Graded Assignments (GA)\nGA6 Doubts Unresolved:\nWhile doubts related to Q1 and Q2 have been addressed, other queries remain unresolved despite being posted in the GA6 thread . The deadline has passed, but no solutions have been provided.\n(Thread link)\nGA Platform Changes:\nInitially, we were solving questions on\nexam.sanand.workers.dev\n. However, in GA6, we moved to\nSeek\nand in GA7, to\nGoogle Forms\n. The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments.\n2. Project Updates\nProject 1:\nThe result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful.\nProject 2:\nThere are multiple doubts posted in the\nProject 2\ndiscussion thread, but they have not been addressed yet. Without these clarifications, it is difficult to proceed with the project. Could you please provide an expected timeline for when these queries will be resolved?\n(thread link)\n3. ROE Score Update\nWhile ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE have still not been updated on the student dashboard. It would be helpful to get confirmation on when these will be reflected.\nI appreciate your time and assistance in addressing these concerns. Looking forward to your response.\nBest regards,\nLakshay"

The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments.\nThe course is in transition. Initially all of it used to be on seek portal. But there were limitations of seek portal that we were not able to work around to deliver the kind of interactive, reactive and rapid corrections/iterations that are now possible because we moved the evaluations from the seek portal to the TDS server. Since the move to the new TDS server on the back end, we are able to also directly see students actual parameterised questions whenever doubts are raised. This is NOT possible on seek portal for us. The results are immediate to see. You got timely rapid feedback for GA 1 to GA 5 from the TAs. The TAs were also able to iterate quickly in discussion with the instructors and the professor as well as operations.\nWith GA 6 our inability to actually see your individual question sets immediately (its possible, but it has to take a very circuitous route via 3 set of people) meant we were always on the back foot for both, checking the answers, as well as making any corrections. And since the questions were parameterised, for technical reasons it was extremely cumbersome/risky/impossible to make changes without it being VERY disruptive to all students. These were some of the reasons we are transitioning. We have seen this problem term after term in prior terms with regards to the seek portal. This is a technological limitation of the current seek portal that directly impacts our ability to react to a dynamic course like TDS.\nGA 7 was decided to submit via forms again for the reasons listed above. GA6 was straightforward because it was a traditional evaluation. Whereas GA7 is once again very unique and does not handle well in being configured in Seek Portal. Since it was not possible in such a short time to transition GA7 to our preferred hosting server and student favourite, we opted for the least disruptive solution that we are able to action very quickly upon.\nlakshaygarg654:\nProject 1:\nThe result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful.\nProject 1 evaluations is VERY computationally intensive for us to evaluate. Each project although dockerised, with an average submission weighing at 2GB, we have to provision space of 1 TB along with the cloud computer resources for all of that (RAM and vCPUs) and if you thought creating project 1 was tough, you can imagine the technical challenge involved in evaluating the 600+ submissions with all the errors and issues we have to fix. In truth its all hands on deck for us here on the back end because it has been deemed critical. So while we are moving the course along, we are also aware that evaluations are at serious risk of missing crucial deadlines. We are taking the matter with utmost seriousness. Its just that we cant always keep you up to date on every set back we are facing.\nEach and everyone of us are concerned about Project 1 and are working on it. Anand, JK, Prasanna, myself, Jivraj and Saransh. We all have been given access to the eval server which we only managed to provision a few days ago and we are all trying to get the most ambitious TDS project evaluation out the dry dock and into the water and hoping it floats gracefully rather than sink in the estuary. Meanwhile we are busy patching the pipes in the belly of the ship while its rolling down the slipway.\nlakshaygarg654:\n3. ROE Score Update\nWhile ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE have still not been updated on the student dashboard. It would be helpful to get confirmation on when these will be reflected.\nYou got the maximum possible mark in ROE. Does it not show you got 100 in ROE in the dashboard? I have been told by operations that it has been pushed.\nKind regards"

We appreciate the efforts of the entire team in ensuring a smooth transition and improving the course experience.\nThe reason for raising this separate post is that multiple doubts related to the course have been left unanswered over the past few days. Even if the course team provides a response without an immediate resolution, it would help us understand the ongoing process and what to expect next.\nWe will wait for the resolution of GA6 issues and the release of Project 1 results. Regarding ROE, we initially assumed that marks would be awarded in the same manner as GA4 (110/100); however, now that you have clarified the maximum marks is 100.\nMeanwhile, we would like to know if a session can be arranged to discuss the solution for Project 1. This would be beneficial for us in working on Project 2. Additionally, any updates regarding the pending queries for Project 2 would be greatly appreciated.\nLooking forward to your response.\nRegards,\nLakshay"

Here are some common real-life uses:\n\n* A contact form that emails you when someone wants to hire you (runs for 2-3 seconds, a few times per day)\n* A tool that converts uploaded photos to black and white (runs for 5-10 seconds when someone uploads a photo)\n* A chatbot that answers basic questions about your business hours (runs for 1-2 seconds per question)\n* A newsletter sign-up that adds emails to your mailing list (runs for 1 second per sign-up)\n* A webhook that posts your Etsy sales to Discord (runs for 1 second whenever you make a sale)\n\nYou only pay when someone uses your tool, and the platform automatically handles busy periods. For example, if 100 people fill out your contact form at once, the platform creates 100 temporary copies of your code to handle them all. When they’re done, these copies disappear. It’s cheaper than running a full-time server because you’re not paying for the time when no one is using your tool - most tools are idle 95% of the time!\n\nRather than writing a full program, serverless platforms let you write functions. These functions are called via HTTP requests. They run in a cloud environment and are scaled up and down automatically. But this means you write programs in a different style. For example:\n\n* You can’t `pip install` packages - you have to use `requirements.txt`\n* You can’t read or write files from the file system - you can only use APIs.\n* You can’t run commands (e.g. `subprocess.run()`)\n\n[Vercel](https://vercel.com/) is a cloud platform optimized for frontend frameworks and serverless functions. Vercel is tightly integrated with GitHub. Pushing to your repository automatically triggers new deployments.\n\nHere’s a [quickstart](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/runtimes/python). [Sign-up with Vercel](https://vercel.com/signup). Create an empty `git` repo with this `api/index.py` file.\n\nTo deploy a FastAPI app, add a `requirements.txt` file with `fastapi` as a dependency.\n\n```\nfastapiCopy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\nAdd your FastAPI code to a file, e.g. `main.py`.\n\n```\n# main.py\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI\n\napp = FastAPI()\n\n@app.get(\"/\")\ndef read_root():\n    return {\"message\": \"Hello, World!\"}Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\nAdd a `vercel.json` file to the root of your repository.\n\n```\n{\n  \"builds\": [{ \"src\": \"main.py\", \"use\": \"@vercel/python\" }],\n  \"routes\": [{ \"src\": \"/(.*)\", \"dest\": \"main.py\" }]\n}Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\nOn the command line, run:\n\n* `npx vercel` to deploy a test version\n* `npx vercel --prod` to deploy to production\n\n**Environment Variables**. Use `npx vercel env add` to add environment variables. In your code, use `os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')` to access them.\n\n### [Videos](#/vercel?id=videos)\n\n[![Vercel Product Walkthrough](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/sPmat30SE4k/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/sPmat30SE4k)\n\n[![Deploy FastAPI on Vercel | Quick and Easy Tutorial](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/8R-cetf_sZ4/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/8R-cetf_sZ4)\n\n[Previous\n\nNotebooks: Google Colab](#/colab)\n\n[Next\n\nCI/CD: GitHub Actions](#/github-actions)"

The first is you can **download** the data. Either somebody gives you the data and says download it from here, or you are asked to download it from the internet because it’s a public data source. But that’s the first way—you download the data.\n2. The second way is you can **query it** from somewhere. It may be on a database. It may be available through an API. It may be available through a library. But these are ways in which you can selectively query parts of the data and stitch it together.\n3. The third way is you have to **scrape it**. It’s not directly available in a convenient form that you can query or download. But it is, in fact, on a web page. It’s available on a PDF file. It’s available in a Word document. It’s available on an Excel file. It’s kind of structured, but you will have to figure out that structure and extract it from there.\n\nIn this module, we will be looking at the tools that will help you either download from a data source or query from an API or from a database or from a library. And finally, how you can scrape from different sources.\n\n[![Data Sourcing - Introduction](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1LyblMkJzOo/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/1LyblMkJzOo)\n\nHere are links used in the video:\n\n* [The Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset)\n* [IMDb Datasets](https://imdb.com/interfaces/)\n* [Download the IMDb Datasets](https://datasets.imdbws.com/)\n* [Explore the Internet Movie Database](https://gramener.com/imdb/)\n* [What does the world search for?](https://gramener.com/search/)\n* [HowStat - Cricket statistics](https://howstat.com/cricket/home.asp)\n* [Cricket Strike Rates](https://gramener.com/cricket/)\n\n[Previous\n\nProject 1](#/project-tds-virtual-ta)\n\n[Next\n\nScraping with Excel](#/scraping-with-excel)"

For example:\n\n* **Content analysis**: Extract clean text from HTML for natural language processing\n* **Data mining**: Strip formatting to focus on the actual content\n* **Offline reading**: Convert web pages to readable formats for e-readers or offline consumption\n* **Content migration**: Move content between different CMS platforms\n* **SEO analysis**: Extract headings, content structure, and text for optimization\n* **Archive creation**: Store web content in more compact, preservation-friendly formats\n* **Accessibility**: Convert content to formats that work better with screen readers\n\nThis tutorial covers both converting existing HTML files and combining web crawling with HTML-to-text conversion in a single workflow – all using the command line.\n\n### [defuddle-cli](#/convert-html-to-markdown?id=defuddle-cli)\n\n[defuddle-cli](https://github.com/defuddle/defuddle) specializes in HTML - Markdown conversion. It’s a bit slow and not very customizable but produces clean Markdown that preserves structure, links, and basic formatting. Best for content where preserving the document structure is important.\n\n```\nfind . -name '*.html' -exec npx --package defuddle-cli -y defuddle parse {} --md -o {}.md \\;Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\n* `find . -name '*.html'`: Finds all HTML files in the current directory and subdirectories\n* `-exec ... \\;`: Executes the following command for each file found\n* `npx --package defuddle-cli -y`: Installs and runs defuddle-cli without prompting\n* `defuddle parse {} --md`: Parses the HTML file (represented by `{}`) and converts to markdown\n* `-o {}.md`: Outputs to a file with the original name plus .md extension\n\n### [Pandoc](#/convert-html-to-markdown?id=pandoc)\n\n[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) is a bit slow and highly customizable, preserving almost all formatting elements, leading to verbose markdown. Best for academic or documentation conversion where precision matters.\n\nPandoc can convert from many other formats (such as Word, PDF, LaTeX, etc.) to Markdown and vice versa, making it one of most popular and versatele document convertors.\n\n[![How to Convert a Word Document to Markdown for Free using Pandoc (12 min)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HPSK7q13-40/sddefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/HPSK7q13-40)\n\n```\nfind . -name '*.html' -exec pandoc -f html -t markdown_strict -o {}.md {} \\;Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\n* `find . -name '*.html'`: Finds all HTML files in the current directory and subdirectories\n* `-exec ... \\;`: Executes the following command for each file found\n* `pandoc`: The Swiss Army knife of document conversion\n* `-f html -t markdown_strict`: Convert from HTML format to strict markdown\n* `-o {}.md {}`: Output to a markdown file, with the input file as the last argument\n\n### [Lynx](#/convert-html-to-markdown?id=lynx)\n\n[Lynx](https://lynx.invisible-island.net/) is fast and generates text (not Markdown) with minimal formatting. Lynx renders the HTML as it would appear in a text browser, preserving basic structure but losing complex formatting. Best for quick content extraction or when processing large numbers of files.\n\n```\nfind . -type f -name '*.html' -exec sh -c 'for f; do lynx -dump -nolist \"$f\" > \"${f%.html}.txt\"; done' _ {} +Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\n* `find . -type f -name '*.html'`: Finds all HTML files in the current directory and subdirectories\n* `-exec sh -c '...' _ {} +`: Executes a shell command with batched files for efficiency\n* `for f; do ... done`: Loops through each file in the batch\n* `lynx -dump -nolist \"$f\"`: Uses the lynx text browser to render HTML as plain text\n  + `-dump`: Output the rendered page to stdout\n  + `-nolist`: Don’t include the list of links at the end\n* `> \"${f%.html}.txt\"`: Save output to a .txt file with the same base name\n\n### [w3m](#/convert-html-to-markdown?id=w3m)\n\n[w3m](https://w3m.sourceforge.net/) is very slow processing with minimal formatting. w3m tends to be more thorough in its rendering than lynx but takes considerably longer. It supports basic JavaScript processing, making it better at handling modern websites with dynamic content. Best for cases where you need slightly better rendering than lynx, particularly for complex layouts and tables, and when some JavaScript processing is beneficial.\n\n```\nfind . -type f -name '*.html' \\\n  -exec sh -c 'for f; do \\\n      w3m -dump -T text/html -cols 80 -no-graph \"$f\" > \"${f%.html}.md\"; \\\n    done' _ {} +Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\n* `find . -type f -name '*.html'`: Finds all HTML files in the current directory and subdirectories\n* `-exec sh -c '...' _ {} +`: Executes a shell command with batched files for efficiency\n* `for f; do ... done`: Loops through each file in the batch\n* `w3m -dump -T text/html -cols 80 -no-graph \"$f\"`: Uses the w3m text browser to render HTML\n  + `-dump`: Output the rendered page to stdout\n  + `-T text/html`: Specify input format as HTML\n  + `-cols 80`: Set output width to 80 columns\n  + `-no-graph`: Don’t show graphic characters for tables and frames\n* `> \"${f%.html}.md\"`: Save output to a .md file with the same base name\n\n### [Comparison](#/convert-html-to-markdown?id=comparison)\n\n| Approach | Speed | Format Quality | Preservation | Best For |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| defuddle-cli | Slow | High | Good structure and links | Content migration, publishing |\n| pandoc | Slow | Very High | Almost everything | Academic papers, documentation |\n| lynx | Fast | Low | Basic structure only | Quick extraction, large batches |\n| w3m | Very Slow | Medium-Low | Basic structure with better tables | Improved readability over lynx |\n\n### [Optimize Batch Processing](#/convert-html-to-markdown?id=optimize-batch-processing)\n\n1. **Process in parallel**: Use GNU Parallel for multi-core processing:\n\n   ```\n   find . -name \"*.html\" | parallel \"pandoc -f html -t markdown_strict -o {}.md {}\"Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\n   ```\n2. **Filter files before processing**:\n\n   ```\n   find . -name \"*.html\" -type f -size -1M -exec pandoc -f html -t markdown {} -o {}.md \\;Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\n   ```\n3. **Customize output format** with additional parameters:\n\n   ```\n   # For pandoc, preserve line breaks but simplify other formatting\n   find . -name \"*.html\" -exec pandoc -f html -t markdown --wrap=preserve --atx-headers {} -o {}.md \\;Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\n   ```\n4. **Handle errors gracefully**:\n\n   ```\n   find . -name \"*.html\" -exec sh -c 'for f; do pandoc -f html -t markdown \"$f\" -o \"${f%.html}.md\" 2>/dev/null || echo \"Failed: $f\" >> conversion_errors.log; done' _ {} +Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\n   ```\n\n### [Choosing the Right Tool](#/convert-html-to-markdown?id=choosing-the-right-tool)\n\n* **Need speed with minimal formatting?** Use the lynx approach\n* **Need precise, complete conversion?** Use pandoc\n* **Need a balance of structure and cleanliness?** Try defuddle-cli\n* **Working with complex tables?** w3m might render them better\n\nRemember that the best approach depends on your specific use case, volume of files, and how you intend to use the converted text.\n\n### [Combined Crawling and Conversion](#/convert-html-to-markdown?id=combined-crawling-and-conversion)\n\nSometimes you need to both crawl a website and convert its content to markdown or text in a single workflow, like [Crawl4AI](#/convert-html-to-markdown?id=crawl4ai) or [markdown-crawler](#/convert-html-to-markdown?id=markdown-crawler).\n\n1. **For research/data collection**: Use a specialized crawler (like Crawl4AI) with post-processing conversion\n2. **For simple website archiving**: Markdown-crawler provides a convenient all-in-one solution\n3. **For high-quality conversion**: Use wget/wget2 for crawling followed by pandoc for conversion\n4. **For maximum speed**: Combine wget with lynx in a pipeline\n\n### [Crawl4AI](#/convert-html-to-markdown?id=crawl4ai)\n\n[Crawl4AI](https://github.com/crawl4ai/crawl4ai) is designed for single-page extraction with high-quality content processing. Crawl4AI is optimized for AI training data extraction, focusing on clean, structured content rather than complete site preservation. It excels at removing boilerplate content and preserving the main article text.\n\n```\nuv venv\nsource .venv/bin/activate.fish\nuv pip install crawl4ai\ncrawl4ai-setupCopy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\n* `uv venv`: Creates a Python virtual environment using uv (a faster alternative to virtualenv)\n* `source .venv/bin/activate.fish`: Activates the virtual environment (fish shell syntax)\n* `uv pip install crawl4ai`: Installs the crawl4ai package\n* `crawl4ai-setup`: Initializes crawl4ai’s required dependencies\n\n### [markdown-crawler](#/convert-html-to-markdown?id=markdown-crawler)\n\n[markdown-crawler](https://pypi.org/project/markdown-crawler/) combines web crawling with markdown conversion in one tool. It’s efficient for bulk processing but tends to produce lower-quality markdown conversion compared to specialized converters like pandoc or defuddle. Best for projects where quantity and integration are more important than perfect formatting.\n\n```\nuv venv\nsource .venv/bin/activate.fish\nuv pip install markdown-crawler\nmarkdown-crawler -t 5 -d 3 -b ./markdown https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\n* `uv venv` and activation: Same as above\n* `uv pip install markdown-crawler`: Installs the markdown-crawler package\n* `markdown-crawler`: Runs the crawler with these options:\n  + `-t 5`: Sets 5 threads for parallel crawling\n  + `-d 3`: Limits crawl depth to 3 levels\n  + `-b ./markdown`: Sets the base output directory\n  + Final argument is the starting URL\n\n[Previous\n\nConvert PDFs to Markdown](#/convert-pdfs-to-markdown)\n\n[Next\n\nLLM Website Scraping](#/llm-website-scraping)"

Users can log in with their existing Google accounts.\n* It’s secure: Google supports OAuth2 and OpenID Connect to handle authentication.\n\nHere’s how you build a FastAPI app that identifies the user.\n\n1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console – Credentials](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials) and click **Create Credentials > OAuth client ID**.\n2. Choose **Web application**, set your authorized redirect URIs (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/`).\n3. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** into a `.env` file:\n\n   ```\n   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com\n   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secretCopy to clipboardErrorCopied\n   ```\n4. Create your FastAPI `app.py`:\n\n```\n# /// script\n# dependencies = [\"python-dotenv\", \"fastapi\", \"uvicorn\", \"itsdangerous\", \"httpx\", \"authlib\"]\n# ///\n\nimport os\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI, Request\nfrom fastapi.responses import RedirectResponse\nfrom starlette.middleware.sessions import SessionMiddleware\nfrom authlib.integrations.starlette_client import OAuth\n\nload_dotenv()\napp = FastAPI()\napp.add_middleware(SessionMiddleware, secret_key=\"create-a-random-secret-key\")\n\noauth = OAuth()\noauth.register(\n    name=\"google\",\n    client_id=os.getenv(\"GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID\"),\n    client_secret=os.getenv(\"GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET\"),\n    server_metadata_url=\"https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration\",\n    client_kwargs={\"scope\": \"openid email profile\"},\n)\n\n@app.get(\"/\")\nasync def application(request: Request):\n    user = request.session.get(\"user\")\n    # 3. For authenticated users: say hello\n    if user:\n        return f\"Hello {user['email']}\"\n    # 2. For users who have just logged in, save their details in the session\n    if \"code\" in request.query_params:\n        token = await oauth.google.authorize_access_token(request)\n        request.session[\"user\"] = token[\"userinfo\"]\n        return RedirectResponse(\"/\")\n    # 1.

When you visit <http://localhost:8000/> you’ll be redirected to a Google login page.\n2. When you log in, you’ll be redirected back to <http://localhost:8000/>\n3. Now you’ll see the email ID you logged in with.\n\nInstead of displaying the email, you can show different content based on the user. For example:\n\n* Allow access to specfic users and not others\n* Fetch the user’s personalized information\n* Display different content based on the user\n\n[Previous\n\nWeb Framework: FastAPI](#/fastapi)\n\n[Next\n\nLocal LLMs: Ollama](#/ollama)"

Its human-readable format and widespread support make it essential for data scientists working with web services, APIs, and configuration files.\n\nFor data scientists, JSON is essential when:\n\n* Working with REST APIs and web services\n* Storing configuration files and metadata\n* Parsing semi-structured data from databases like MongoDB\n* Creating data visualization specifications (e.g., Vega-Lite)\n\nWatch this comprehensive introduction to JSON (15 min):\n\n[![JSON Crash Course](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/GpOO5iKzOmY/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/GpOO5iKzOmY)\n\nKey concepts to understand in JSON:\n\n* JSON only supports 6 data types: strings, numbers, booleans, null, arrays, and objects\n* You can nest data. Arrays and objects can contain other data types, including other arrays and objects\n* Always validate. Ensure JSON is well-formed. Comm errors: Trailing commas, missing quotes, and escape characters\n\n[JSON Lines](https://jsonlines.org/) is a format that allows you to store multiple JSON objects in a single line.\nIt’s useful for logging and streaming data.\n\nTools you could use with JSON:\n\n* [JSONLint](https://jsonlint.com/): Validate and format JSON\n* [JSON Editor Online](https://jsoneditoronline.org/): Visual JSON editor and formatter\n* [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/): Define the structure of your JSON data\n* [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/): Command-line JSON processor\n\nCommon Python operations with JSON:\n\n```\nimport json\n\n# Parse JSON string\njson_str = '{\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30}'\ndata = json.loads(json_str)\n\n# Convert to JSON string\njson_str = json.dumps(data, indent=2)\n\n# Read JSON from file\nwith open('data.json') as f:\n    data = json.load(f)\n\n# Write JSON to file\nwith open('output.json', 'w') as f:\n    json.dump(data, f, indent=2)\n\n# Read JSON data a Pandas DataFrame. JSON data is typically stored as an array of objects.\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.read_json('data.json')\n\n# Read JSON lines from file into a DataFrame. JSON lines are typically one line per object.\ndf = pd.read_json('data.jsonl', lines=True)Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\nPractice JSON skills with these resources:\n\n* [JSON Generator](https://json-generator.com/): Create sample JSON data\n* [JSON Path Finder](https://jsonpathfinder.com/): Learn to navigate complex JSON structures\n* [JSON Schema Validator](https://www.jsonschemavalidator.net/): Validate JSON against schemas\n\n[Previous\n\nCSS Selectors](#/css-selectors)\n\n[Next\n\nTerminal: Bash](#/bash)"

Below are common cleaning tasks using the DuckDB CLI.\n\n### [Create a Sample Dataset](#/data-preparation-in-duckdb?id=create-a-sample-dataset)\n\nLet’s create a sample dataset that mimics real business data patterns - incomplete customer records, time-series orders, and regional variations. Before working with messy production data, you need a controlled environment to test data cleaning techniques. This sample represents common e-commerce scenarios: missing customer info (20% of orders), seasonal patterns (15-day cycles), and geographic segmentation that drive business decisions like inventory placement and marketing campaigns.\n\n```\nduckdb sample.duckdb <<'SQL'\nCREATE OR REPLACE TABLE orders AS\nSELECT\n  seq AS order_id,\n  CASE WHEN seq % 5 = 0 THEN NULL ELSE 'Customer ' || seq END AS customer,\n  date '2025-01-01' + CAST(seq % 15 AS INTEGER) AS order_date,\n  CASE WHEN seq % 3 = 0 THEN 'Widget ' || seq ELSE 'Gadget ' || seq END AS product,\n  round(random()*1000, 2) AS amount,\n  CASE WHEN seq % 4 = 0 THEN 'EU' ELSE 'US' END AS region\nFROM range(1, 50) tbl(seq);\nSQLCopy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\n### [Create a Messy CSV](#/data-preparation-in-duckdb?id=create-a-messy-csv)\n\nLet’s also simulate real-world data export issues - unescaped quotes, missing delimiters, and malformed records that break standard CSV parsers. Data rarely arrives clean. Export systems fail, manual data entry introduces errors, and third-party integrations send malformed files. Learning to handle corrupted CSV files prevents hours of debugging and ensures your data pipeline doesn’t break when inevitably receiving bad data from vendors, APIs, or legacy systems.\n\n```\ncat <<'EOF' > messy_orders.csv\norder_id,customer,order_date,product,amount,region\n1,Customer 1,2025-01-01,Widget 1,100,US\n\"2,Customer 2,2025-01-02,Gadget 2,200,US\n3,Customer 3,2025-01-03,Gadget 3,300,EU\nEOFCopy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\n### [Create a Big CSV](#/data-preparation-in-duckdb?id=create-a-big-csv)\n\nNext, we’ll create a large dataset to practice memory-efficient processing techniques that handle files too big to fit in RAM. When working with millions of customer records, transaction logs, or sensor data, traditional tools crash or run out of memory. DuckDB’s streaming capabilities let you process 100GB+ files on laptops by reading data in chunks, making big data analysis accessible without expensive infrastructure.\n\n```\nduckdb sample.duckdb <<'SQL'\nCOPY (SELECT seq AS id, random() AS val FROM range(100000)) TO 'big.csv';\nSQLCopy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\n### [Exploratory Data Analysis](#/data-preparation-in-duckdb?id=exploratory-data-analysis)\n\nWe need to examine our data structure and quality before making business decisions. Every data analysis starts with understanding what you have - missing values can skew customer segmentation, outliers affect revenue forecasting, and data types determine which analytical techniques work. Quick EDA prevents costly mistakes like launching marketing campaigns based on incomplete customer data or setting prices using corrupted transaction amounts.\n\n```\n-- Preview and get stats\nSELECT * FROM orders LIMIT 5;\nDESCRIBE orders;\nSELECT COUNT(*) AS n, AVG(amount) AS avg_amount FROM orders;Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\n### [Converting Data to Other Formats](#/data-preparation-in-duckdb?id=converting-data-to-other-formats)\n\nLet’s export cleaned data to formats optimized for different business needs. Analytics teams need Parquet for fast querying, APIs require JSON for web integration, and executives want CSV for Excel compatibility. Format conversion ensures your cleaned data reaches every stakeholder in their preferred format, enabling faster decision-making across departments without forcing everyone to learn SQL.\n\n```\nCOPY (SELECT * FROM orders) TO 'orders.json' (FORMAT JSON);\nCOPY (SELECT * FROM orders) TO 'orders.parquet' (FORMAT PARQUET);Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\n### [Reading Messy CSV](#/data-preparation-in-duckdb?id=reading-messy-csv)\n\nWe need to handle corrupted files that would normally crash your data pipeline. Real-world CSV files from vendors, legacy systems, or manual exports often contain malformed rows that break standard parsers. Instead of spending hours manually fixing files or losing critical business data, DuckDB’s error handling lets you salvage usable records while identifying problem areas for follow-up with data providers.\n\n```\n-- Skip bad lines while loading\nSELECT *\nFROM read_csv_auto('messy_orders.csv', ignore_errors=true);Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\n### [Handling Missing Values](#/data-preparation-in-duckdb?id=handling-missing-values)\n\nIt’s important to address incomplete data that could lead to wrong business conclusions. Missing customer names prevent personalized marketing, absent transaction amounts skew revenue calculations, and incomplete addresses block shipping. Rather than excluding entire records and losing valuable information, strategic imputation preserves data for analysis while clearly marking assumptions made during the cleaning process.\n\n```\n-- Replace null customer names\nSELECT COALESCE(customer, 'Unknown') AS customer FROM orders;Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\n### [String Operations](#/data-preparation-in-duckdb?id=string-operations)\n\nIt’s common to standardize text data that comes from multiple sources with inconsistent formatting. Product names from different suppliers use varying cases, customer entries have extra spaces, and imported data contains mixed formatting. Clean, consistent strings enable accurate grouping for inventory management, prevent duplicate customer records, and ensure search functionality works properly across your application.\n\n```\nSELECT DISTINCT TRIM(LOWER(product)) AS clean_product FROM orders;Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\n### [Date Parsing and Conversion](#/data-preparation-in-duckdb?id=date-parsing-and-conversion)\n\nTypically, we transform dates into different formats that enable time-based business analysis. Raw date strings from different systems use various formats that prevent proper sorting and filtering. Converting to standard formats enables monthly sales reporting, seasonal trend analysis, and time-based customer segmentation - critical for inventory planning, marketing campaigns, and financial forecasting.\n\n```\nSELECT order_id, STRFTIME(order_date, '%Y-%m') AS order_month FROM orders;Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\n### [Conditional Logic and Binning](#/data-preparation-in-duckdb?id=conditional-logic-and-binning)\n\nA common task is to categorize continuous data into meaningful business segments that drive decision-making. Converting exact dollar amounts into price tiers enables targeted marketing (premium vs budget customers), inventory classification (high/medium/low value items), and commission structures. This segmentation forms the foundation for personalized pricing, customer targeting, and performance analysis.\n\n```\nSELECT\n  order_id,\n  CASE WHEN amount > 700 THEN 'high' WHEN amount > 300 THEN 'medium' ELSE 'low' END AS price_band\nFROM orders;Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\n### [Regex Search and Replace](#/data-preparation-in-duckdb?id=regex-search-and-replace)\n\nWe often need to clean complex text patterns that simple string operations can’t handle. Product descriptions contain multiple spaces, phone numbers have inconsistent formatting, and addresses mix abbreviations with full words. Regular expressions fix these patterns systematically, ensuring consistent data quality for customer communications, shipping integrations, and search functionality.\n\n```\nSELECT REGEXP_REPLACE(product, '\\\\s+', ' ', 'g') AS tidy_product FROM orders;Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\n### [Working with Multiple Formats](#/data-preparation-in-duckdb?id=working-with-multiple-formats)\n\nLet’s combine data from different sources that use various file formats. Modern businesses receive data as CSV exports, JSON from APIs, and Parquet from data warehouses. Rather than maintaining separate processing pipelines, DuckDB’s format flexibility lets you join orders from your CSV exports with customer data from JSON APIs and inventory levels from Parquet files in a single query.\n\n```\nCREATE TABLE json_orders AS SELECT * FROM read_json_auto('orders.json');\nCREATE TABLE parquet_orders AS SELECT * FROM read_parquet('orders.parquet');\nSELECT * FROM orders UNION ALL SELECT * FROM parquet_orders;Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\n### [Processing in Chunks](#/data-preparation-in-duckdb?id=processing-in-chunks)\n\nWe handle massive datasets that exceed available memory by processing them in manageable segments. When analyzing years of transaction logs, customer behavior data, or sensor readings, loading everything at once crashes systems. Chunk processing enables analysis of terabyte-scale datasets on standard hardware, making enterprise-level data analysis accessible for fraud detection, customer lifetime value calculations, and operational analytics.\n\n```\nSELECT * FROM read_csv_auto('big.csv') LIMIT 1000 OFFSET 0;\nSELECT * FROM read_csv_auto('big.csv') LIMIT 1000 OFFSET 1000;Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\n### [Filtering Rows and Dropping Columns](#/data-preparation-in-duckdb?id=filtering-rows-and-dropping-columns)\n\nWe’ll focus analysis on relevant data subsets while removing sensitive or unnecessary information. Business analysis rarely needs all data - marketing teams want current customers, finance needs profitable regions, and product managers focus on active items. Efficient filtering reduces processing time, protects sensitive data (removing PII columns), and ensures analysis focuses on business-relevant subsets rather than getting lost in comprehensive but unfocused datasets.\n\n```\nSELECT order_id, amount FROM orders WHERE region = 'US';\nSELECT * EXCLUDE region FROM orders;Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\n### [Derived Columns](#/data-preparation-in-duckdb?id=derived-columns)\n\nNow, let’s create new business metrics from existing data that drive key performance indicators. Raw transaction amounts become profit margins with tax calculations, customer regions enable territory-based analysis, and dates support seasonal comparisons. These derived metrics power executive dashboards, sales team performance tracking, and automated business rules without requiring manual calculations or separate reporting tools.\n\n```\nSELECT *, amount * 0.1 AS tax, UPPER(region) AS region_code FROM orders;Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\n### [Summaries and Pivots](#/data-preparation-in-duckdb?id=summaries-and-pivots)\n\nA big part of data preparation is to transform detailed transaction data into executive-level insights that inform strategic decisions. Converting thousands of individual orders into regional sales summaries, customer segment performance, and product category trends enables quick identification of growth opportunities, underperforming markets, and inventory optimization needs. These aggregations become the foundation for board presentations, budget planning, and strategic initiatives.\n\n```\n-- Aggregation\nSELECT region, COUNT(*) AS n_orders, SUM(amount) AS total FROM orders GROUP BY region;\n\n-- Pivot by region\nSELECT *\nFROM orders\nPIVOT(COUNT(*) FOR region IN ('US', 'EU'));Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\nUseful links:\n\n* [DuckDB Documentation](https://duckdb.org/docs/)\n* [SQL Functions](https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/functions/overview)\n* [DuckDB Extensions](https://duckdb.org/docs/extensions/overview)\n\n[Previous\n\nData Preparation in the Editor](#/data-preparation-in-the-editor)\n\n[Next\n\nCleaning Data with OpenRefine](#/cleaning-data-with-openrefine)"

specific properties.\nSee the [Supported schemas](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs#supported-schemas).\n\nHere’s an example of a function definition for scheduling a meeting:\n\n```\nMEETING_TOOL = {\n    \"type\": \"function\",\n    \"function\": {\n        \"name\": \"schedule_meeting\",\n        \"description\": \"Schedule a meeting room for a specific date and

clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\n### [How to define multiple functions](#/function-calling?id=how-to-define-multiple-functions)\n\nYou can define multiple functions by passing a list of function definitions to the `tools` parameter.\n\nHere’s an example of a list of function definitions for handling employee expenses and calculating performance bonuses:\n\n```\ntools = [\n    {\n        \"type\": \"function\",\n        \"function\": {\n            \"name\": \"get_expense_balance\",\n            \"description\": \"Get expense balance for an employee\",\n            \"parameters\": {\n

\"description\": \"Employee ID number\"\n                    }\n                },\n                \"required\": [\"employee_id\"],\n                \"additionalProperties\": False\n            },\n            \"strict\": True\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"type\": \"function\",\n        \"function\": {\n            \"name\": \"calculate_performance_bonus\",\n            \"description\": \"Calculate yearly performance bonus for an employee\",\n            \"parameters\": {\n                \"type\": \"object\",\n                \"properties\": {\n                    \"employee_id\": {\n                        \"type\": \"integer\",\n                        \"description\": \"Employee ID number\"\n                    },\n                    \"current_year\": {\n                        \"type\": \"integer\",\n                        \"description\": \"Year to calculate bonus for\"\n                    }\n                },\n                \"required\": [\"employee_id\", \"current_year\"],\n                \"additionalProperties\": False\n            },\n            \"strict\": True\n        }\n    }\n]Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\nBest Practices:\n\n1. **Use Strict Mode**\n   * Always set `strict: True` to ensure valid function calls\n   * Define all required parameters\n   * Set `additionalProperties: False`\n2. **Use tool choice**\n   * Set `tool_choice: \"required\"` to ensure that the model will always call one or more tools\n   * The default is `tool_choice: \"auto\"` which means the model will choose a tool only if appropriate\n3. **Clear Descriptions**\n   * Write detailed function and parameter descriptions\n   * Include expected formats and units\n   * Mention any constraints or limitations\n4. **Error Handling**\n   * Validate function inputs before execution\n   * Return clear error messages\n   * Handle missing or invalid parameters\n\n[Previous\n\nHybrid RAG with

We’ll use that capability.\n\nSave the following as `addnotes.py` and run it with `uv run addnotes.py`.\n\n```\n# /// script\n# requires-python = \">=3.13\"\n# dependencies = [\"httpx\"]\n# ///\nimport json\nimport httpx\nimport os\n\nheaders = {\"X-TYPESENSE-API-KEY\": \"secret-key\"}\n\nschema = {\n    \"name\": \"notes\",\n    \"fields\": [\n        {\"name\": \"id\", \"type\": \"string\", \"facet\": False},\n        {\"name\": \"content\", \"type\": \"string\", \"facet\": False},\n        {\n            \"name\": \"embedding\",\n            \"type\": \"float[]\",\n            \"embed\": {\n                \"from\": [\"content\"],\n                \"model_config\": {\n                    \"model_name\": \"openai/text-embedding-3-small\",\n                    \"api_key\": os.getenv(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"),\n                },\n            },\n        },\n    ],\n}\n\nwith open(\"chunks.json\", \"r\") as f:\n    chunks = [json.loads(line) for line in f.readlines()]\n\nwith httpx.Client() as client:\n    # Create the collection\n    if client.get(f\"http://localhost:8108/collections/notes\", headers=headers).status_code == 404:\n        r = client.post(\"http://localhost:8108/collections\", json=schema, headers=headers)\n\n    # Embed the chunks\n    result = client.post(\n        \"http://localhost:8108/collections/notes/documents/import?action=emplace\",\n        headers={**headers, \"Content-Type\": \"text/plain\"},\n        data=\"\\n\".join(json.dumps(chunk) for chunk in chunks),\n    )\n    print(result.text)Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\n* **`httpx.Client`**: an HTTP client for Python.\n* **Collection schema**: `id` and `content` fields plus an `embedding` field with auto-generated embeddings from OpenAI.\n* **Auto-embedding**: the `embed` block instructs TypeSense to call the specified model for each document.\n* **`GET /collections/notes`**: checks existence.\n* **`POST /collections`**: creates the collection.\n* **`POST /collections/notes/documents/import?action=emplace`**: bulk upsert documents, embedding them on the fly.\n\n**Expected output:**\n\n* A JSON summary string like `{\"success\": X, \"failed\": 0}` indicating how many docs were imported.\n* (On timeouts, re-run until all chunks are processed.)\n\n### [4. Run a hybrid search and answer a question](#/hybrid-rag-typesense?id=_4-run-a-hybrid-search-and-answer-a-question)\n\nNow, we can use a single `curl` against the Multi-Search endpoint to combine keyword and vector search as a [hybrid search](https://typesense.org/docs/28.0/api/vector-search.html#hybrid-search):\n\n```\nQ=\"What does the author affectionately call the => syntax?\"\n\npayload=$(jq -n --arg coll \"notes\" --arg q \"$Q\" \\\n  '{\n     searches: [\n       {\n         collection: $coll,\n         q:           $q,\n         query_by:    \"content,embedding\",\n         sort_by:     \"_text_match:desc\",\n         prefix:      false,\n         exclude_fields: \"embedding\"\n       }\n     ]\n   }'\n)\ncurl -s 'http://localhost:8108/multi_search' \\\n  -H \"X-TYPESENSE-API-KEY: secret-key\" \\\n  -d \"$payload\" \\\n  | jq -r '.results[].hits[].document.content' \\\n  | llm -s \"${Q} - \\$Answer ONLY from these notes. Cite verbatim from the notes.\" \\\n  | uvx streamdownCopy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\n* **`query_by: \"content,embedding\"`**: tells TypeSense to score by both keyword and vector similarity.\n* **`sort_by: \"_text_match:desc\"`**: boosts exact text hits.\n* **`exclude_fields: \"embedding\"`**: keeps responses lightweight.\n* **`curl -d`**: posts the search request.\n* **`jq -r`**: extracts each hit’s `content`. See [jq manual](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/)\n* **`llm -s`** and **`uvx streamdown`**: generate and stream a grounded answer.\n\n**Expected output:**\n\n* The raw matched snippets printed first.\n* Then a concise, streamed LLM answer citing the note verbatim.\n\n[Previous\n\nRAG with the CLI)](#/rag-cli)\n\n[Next\n\nFunction Calling](#/function-calling)"

Unlike simple prompt-response patterns, agents make multiple LLM calls, use tools, and adapt their approach based on intermediate results. They represent a significant step toward more autonomous AI systems.\n\n[![Building LLM Agents with LangChain (13 min)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/DWUdGhRrv2c/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/DWUdGhRrv2c)\n\n### [What Makes an Agent?](#/llm-agents?id=what-makes-an-agent)\n\nAn LLM agent consists of three core components:\n\n1. **LLM Brain**: Makes decisions about what to do next\n2. **Tools**: External capabilities the agent can use (e.g., web search, code execution)\n3. **Memory**: Retains context across multiple steps\n\nAgents operate through a loop:\n\n* Observe the environment\n* Think about what to do\n* Take action using tools\n* Observe results\n* Repeat until task completion\n\n### [Command-Line Agent Example](#/llm-agents?id=command-line-agent-example)\n\nWe’ve created a minimal command-line agent called [`llm-cmd-agent.py`](llm-cmd-agent.py) that:\n\n1. Takes a task description from the command line\n2. Generates code to accomplish the task\n3. Automatically extracts and executes the code\n4. Passes the results back to the LLM\n5. Provides a final answer or tries again if the execution fails\n\nHere’s how it works:\n\n```\nuv run llm-cmd-agent.py \"list all Python files under the current directory, recursively, by size\"\nuv run llm-cmd-agent.py \"convert the largest Markdown file to HTML\"Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\nThe agent will:\n\n1. Generate a shell script to list files with their sizes\n2. Execute the script in a subprocess\n3. Capture the output (stdout and stderr)\n4. Pass the output back to the LLM for interpretation\n5. Present a final answer to the user\n\nUnder the hood, the agent follows this workflow:\n\n1. Initial prompt to generate a shell script\n2. Code extraction from the LLM response\n3. Code execution in a subprocess\n4. Result interpretation by the LLM\n5. Error handling and retry logic if needed\n\nThis demonstrates the core agent loop of:\n\n* Planning (generating code)\n* Execution (running the code)\n* Reflection (interpreting results)\n* Adaptation (fixing errors if needed)\n\n### [Agent Architectures](#/llm-agents?id=agent-architectures)\n\nDifferent agent architectures exist for different use cases:\n\n1. **ReAct** (Reasoning + Acting): Interleaves reasoning steps with actions\n2. **Reflexion**: Adds self-reflection to improve reasoning\n3. **MRKL** (Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language): Combines neural and symbolic modules\n4. **Plan-and-Execute**: Creates a plan first, then executes steps\n\n### [Real-World Applications](#/llm-agents?id=real-world-applications)\n\nLLM agents can be applied to various domains:\n\n1. **Research assistants** that search, summarize, and synthesize information\n2. **Coding assistants** that write, debug, and explain code\n3. **Data analysis agents** that clean, visualize, and interpret data\n4. **Customer service agents** that handle queries and perform actions\n5. **Personal assistants** that manage schedules, emails, and tasks\n\n### [Project Ideas](#/llm-agents?id=project-ideas)\n\nHere are some practical agent projects you could build:\n\n1. **Study buddy agent**: Helps create flashcards, generates practice questions, and explains concepts\n2. **Job application assistant**: Searches job listings, tailors resumes, and prepares interview responses\n3. **Personal finance agent**: Categorizes expenses, suggests budgets, and identifies savings opportunities\n4. **Health and fitness coach**: Creates workout plans, tracks nutrition, and provides motivation\n5. **Course project helper**: Breaks down assignments, suggests resources, and reviews work\n\n### [Best Practices](#/llm-agents?id=best-practices)\n\n1. **Clear instructions**: Define the agent’s capabilities and limitations\n2. **Effective tool design**: Create tools that are specific and reliable\n3. **Robust error handling**: Agents should recover gracefully from failures\n4. **Memory management**: Balance context retention with token efficiency\n5. **User feedback**: Allow users to correct or guide the agent\n\n### [Limitations and Challenges](#/llm-agents?id=limitations-and-challenges)\n\nCurrent LLM agents face several challenges:\n\n1. **Hallucination**: Agents may generate false information or tool calls\n2. **Planning limitations**: Complex tasks require better planning capabilities\n3. **Tool integration complexity**: Each new tool adds implementation overhead\n4. **Context window constraints**: Limited memory for long-running tasks\n5. **Security concerns**: Tool access requires careful permission management\n\n[Previous\n\nFunction Calling](#/function-calling)\n\n[Next\n\nLLM Image Generation](#/llm-image-generation)"

In this tutorial, we’ll explore tools to flatten, stream, and query JSON data efficiently.\n\nFor example, we’ll often need to process a multi-gigabyte log file from a web service where each record is a JSON object.\n\n[![JSON Parsing in Python](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1lxrb_ezP-g/sddefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/1lxrb_ezP-g)\n\nThis requires us to handle complex nested structures, large files that don’t fit in memory, or extract specific fields. Here are the key tools and techniques for efficient JSON parsing:\n\n| Tool | Extract from JSON… | Why |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| [jq](#/parsing-json?id=command-line-json-processing-with-jq) | JSON in the shell | Quick data exploration and pipeline processing |\n| [JMESPath](#/parsing-json?id=jmespath-queries) | JSON in Python | Handle complex queries with a clean syntax |\n| [ijson](#/parsing-json?id=streaming-with-ijson) | JSON streams in Python | Parse streaming/large JSON files memory-efficiently |\n| [Pandas](#/parsing-json?id=pandas-json-columns) | JSON columns in Python | Fast analysis of structured data |\n| [SQL JSON](#/parsing-json?id=sql-json-functions) | JSON in databases | Combine structured and semi-structured data |\n| [DuckDB](#/parsing-json?id=duckdb-json-processing) | JSON anywhere | Fast analysis of JSON files / databases without loading to memory |\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Use Pandas when you need to transform API responses into a DataFrame for further analysis.\n* Leverage ijson when dealing with huge JSON logs where memory is at a premium.\n* Apply jq for quick, iterative exploration directly in your terminal.\n\nPractice with these resources:\n\n* [JSONPath Online Evaluator](https://jsonpath.com/): Test JSON queries\n* [jq play](https://jqplay.org/): Interactive jq query testing\n* [DuckDB JSON Tutorial](https://duckdb.org/docs/data/json): Learn DuckDB JSON functions\n\n### [Command-line JSON Processing with jq](#/parsing-json?id=command-line-json-processing-with-jq)\n\n[jq](https://jqlang.org/) is a versatile command-line tool for slicing, filtering, and transforming JSON. It excels in quick data exploration and can be integrated into shell scripts for automated data pipelines.\n\n**Example:** Sifting through server logs in JSON Lines format to extract error messages or aggregate metrics without launching a full-scale ETL process.\n\n```\n# Extract specific fields from JSONL\ncat data.jsonl | jq -c 'select(.type == \"user\") | {id, name}'\n\n# Transform JSON structure\ncat data.json | jq '.items[] | {name: .name, count: .details.count}'\n\n# Filter and aggregate\ncat events.jsonl | jq -s 'group_by(.category) | map({category: .[0].category, count: length})'Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\n### [JMESPath Queries](#/parsing-json?id=jmespath-queries)\n\n[JMESPath](https://jmespath.org/) offers a declarative query language to extract and transform data from nested JSON structures without needing verbose code. It’s a neat alternative when you want to quickly pull out specific values or filter collections based on conditions.\n\n**Example:** Extracting user emails or filtering out inactive records from a complex JSON payload received from a cloud service.\n\n```\nimport jmespath\n\n# Example queries\ndata = {\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\"name\": \"Seattle\", \"state\": \"WA\", \"info\": {\"population\": 737015}},\n        {\"name\": \"Portland\", \"state\": \"OR\", \"info\": {\"population\": 652503}}\n    ]\n}\n\n# Find all cities with population > 700000\ncities = jmespath.search(\"locations[?info.population > `700000`].name\", data)Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\n### [Streaming with ijson](#/parsing-json?id=streaming-with-ijson)\n\nLoading huge JSON files all at once can quickly exhaust system memory. [ijson](https://ijson.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) lets you stream and process JSON incrementally. This method is ideal when your JSON file is too large or when you only need to work with part of the data.\n\n**Example:** Processing a continuous feed from an API that returns a large JSON array, such as sensor data or event logs, while filtering on the fly.\n\n```\nimport ijson\n\nasync def process_large_json(filepath: str) -> list:\n    \"\"\"Process a large JSON file without loading it entirely into memory.\"\"\"\n    results = []\n\n    with open(filepath, 'rb') as file:\n        # Stream objects under the 'items' key\n        parser = ijson.items(file, 'items.item')\n        async for item in parser:\n            if item['value'] > 100:  # Process conditionally\n                results.append(item)\n\n    return resultsCopy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\n### [Pandas JSON Columns](#/parsing-json?id=pandas-json-columns)\n\n[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) makes it easy to work with tabular data that includes JSON strings. When you receive API data where one column holds nested JSON, flattening these structures lets you analyze and visualize the data using familiar DataFrame operations.\n\n**Example:** Flattening customer records stored as nested JSON in a CSV file to extract demographic details and spending patterns.\n\n```\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Parse JSON strings in a column\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'json_col': ['{\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30}', '{\"name\": \"Bob\", \"age\": 25}']})\ndf['parsed'] = df['json_col'].apply(pd.json_normalize)\n\n# Normalize nested JSON columns\ndf = pd.read_csv('data.csv')\ndf_normalized = pd.json_normalize(\n    df['nested_json'].apply(json.loads),\n    record_path=['items'],        # List of nested objects to unpack\n    meta=['id', 'timestamp']      # Keep these columns from parent\n)Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\n### [SQL JSON Functions](#/parsing-json?id=sql-json-functions)\n\n[SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL:2016) supports built-in JSON functions allow you to query and manipulate JSON stored within relational databases.\nThese are implemented by most popular databases, including\n[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/json1.html),\n[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html), and\n[MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/json-function-reference.html).\nThis is especially handy when you have a hybrid data model, combining structured tables with semi-structured JSON columns.\n\n**Example:** An application that stores user settings or application logs as JSON in a SQLite database, enabling quick lookups and modifications without external JSON parsing libraries.\n\n```\nSELECT\n    json_extract(data, '$.name') as name,\n    json_extract(data, '$.details.age') as age\nFROM users\nWHERE json_extract(data, '$.active') = trueCopy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\n### [DuckDB JSON Processing](#/parsing-json?id=duckdb-json-processing)\n\n[DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) shines when analyzing JSON/JSONL files directly, making it a powerful tool for data analytics without the overhead of loading entire datasets into memory. Its SQL-like syntax simplifies exploratory analysis on nested data.\n\n**Example:** Performing ad-hoc analytics on streaming JSON logs from a web service, such as calculating average response times or aggregating user behavior metrics.\n\n```\nSELECT\n    json_extract_string(data, '$.user.name') as name,\n    avg(json_extract_float(data, '$.metrics.value')) as avg_value\nFROM read_json_auto('data/*.jsonl')\nGROUP BY 1\nHAVING avg_value > 100Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\n[Previous\n\nCleaning Data with OpenRefine](#/cleaning-data-with-openrefine)\n\n[Next\n\nData Transformation with dbt](#/dbt)"

This generates a public URL that you can share with others.\n\nTo get started, log into `ngrok.com` and [get an authtoken from the dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken). Copy it. Then run:\n\n```\nngrok config add-authtoken $YOUR_AUTHTOKENCopy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\nNow you can forward any local port to the internet. For example:\n\n```\n# Start a local server on port 8000\nuv run -m http.server 8000\n\n# Start HTTP tunnel\nuvx ngrok http 8000Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\nHere are useful things you can do with `ngrok http`:\n\n* `ngrok http file://.` to serve local files\n* `--response-header-add \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *\"` to enable CORS\n* `--oauth google --oauth-client-id $CLIENT_ID --oauth-client-secret $SECRET --oauth-allow-domain example.com --oauth-allow-email user@example.org` to restrict users to @example.com and [user@example.org](mailto:user@example.org) using Google Auth\n* `--ua-filter-deny \".*bot$\"` to reject user agents ending with `bot`\n\n[Previous\n\nDevContainers: GitHub Codespaces](#/github-codespaces)\n\n[Next\n\nCORS](#/cors)"

These are like a map of text in numerical form. Each number represents a feature, and similar texts will have numbers close to each other. So, if the numbers are similar, the text they represent mean something similar.\n\nThis is useful because text similarity is important in many common problems:\n\n1. **Search**. Find similar documents to a query.\n2. **Classification**. Classify text into categories.\n3. **Clustering**. Group similar items into clusters.\n4. **Anomaly Detection**. Find an unusual piece of text.\n\nYou can run embedding models locally or using an API. Local models are better for privacy and cost. APIs are better for scale and quality.\n\n| Feature | Local Models | API |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Privacy** | High | Dependent on provider |\n| **Cost** | High setup, low after that | Pay-as-you-go |\n| **Scale** | Limited by local resources | Easily scales with demand |\n| **Quality** | Varies by model | Typically high |\n\nThe [Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard) provides comprehensive comparisons of embedding models. These models are compared on several parameters, but here are some key ones to look at:\n\n1. **Rank**. Higher ranked models have higher quality.\n2. **Memory Usage**. Lower is better (for similar ranks). It costs less and is faster to run.\n3. **Embedding Dimensions**. Lower is better. This is the number of numbers in the array. Smaller dimensions are cheaper to store.\n4. **Max Tokens**. Higher is better. This is the number of input tokens (words) the model can take in a *single* input.\n5. Look for higher scores in the columns for Classification, Clustering, Summarization, etc. based on your needs.\n\n### [Local Embeddings](#/embeddings?id=local-embeddings)\n\n[![Guide to Local Embeddings with Sentence Transformers](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OATCgQtNX2o/sddefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/OATCgQtNX2o)\n\nHere’s a minimal example using a local embedding model:\n\n```\n# /// script\n# requires-python = \"==3.12\"\n# dependencies = [\n#   \"sentence-transformers\",\n#   \"httpx\",\n#   \"numpy\",\n# ]\n# ///\n\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\nimport numpy as np\n\nmodel = SentenceTransformer('BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5')  # A small, high quality model\n\nasync def embed(text: str) -> list[float]:\n    \"\"\"Get embedding vector for text using local model.\"\"\"\n    return model.encode(text).tolist()\n\nasync def get_similarity(text1: str, text2: str) -> float:\n    \"\"\"Calculate cosine similarity between two texts.\"\"\"\n    emb1 = np.array(await embed(text1))\n    emb2 = np.array(await embed(text2))\n    return float(np.dot(emb1, emb2) / (np.linalg.norm(emb1) * np.linalg.norm(emb2)))\n\nasync def main():\n    print(await get_similarity(\"Apple\", \"Orange\"))\n    print(await get_similarity(\"Apple\", \"Lightning\"))\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    import asyncio\n    asyncio.run(main())Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\nNote the `get_similarity` function. It uses a [Cosine Similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity) to calculate the similarity between two embeddings.\n\n### [OpenAI Embeddings](#/embeddings?id=openai-embeddings)\n\nFor comparison, here’s how to use OpenAI’s API with direct HTTP calls.

(Don’t exceed that.)\n\nRead the [AI Pipe documentation](https://github.com/sanand0/aipipe) to learn how to use it. But in short:\n\n1. Replace `OPENAI_BASE_URL`, i.e. `https://api.openai.com/v1` with `https://aipipe.org/openrouter/v1...` or `https://aipipe.org/openai/v1...`\n2. Replace `OPENAI_API_KEY` with the [`AIPIPE_TOKEN`](https://aipipe.org/login)\n3. Replace model names, e.g. `gpt-4.1-nano`, with `openai/gpt-4.1-nano`\n\nFor example, let’s use [Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/models/gemini/2-0-flash-lite) via [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001) for chat completions and [Text Embedding 3 Small](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/text-embedding-3-small) via [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/) for embeddings:\n\n```\ncurl https://aipipe.org/openrouter/v1/chat/completions \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $AIPIPE_TOKEN\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"model\": \"google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001\",\n    \"messages\": [{ \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What is 2 + 2?\"} }]\n  }'\n\ncurl https://aipipe.org/openai/v1/embeddings \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $AIPIPE_TOKEN\" \\\n  -d '{ \"model\": \"text-embedding-3-small\", \"input\": \"What is 2 + 2?\" }'Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\nOr using [`llm`](https://llm.datasette.io/):\n\n```\nllm keys set openai --value $AIPIPE_TOKEN\n\nexport OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://aipipe.org/openrouter/v1\nllm 'What is 2 + 2?' -m openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001\n\nexport OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://aipipe.org/openai/v1\nllm embed -c 'What is 2 + 2' -m 3-smallCopy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\n**For a 50% discount** (but slower speed), use [Flex processing](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/flex-processing) by adding `service_tier: \"flex\"` to your JSON request.\n\n[AI Proxy - Jan 2025](#/large-language-models?id=ai-proxy-jan-2025)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor the Jan 2025 batch, we had created API keys for everyone with an `iitm.ac.in` email to use `gpt-4o-mini` and `text-embedding-3-small`.

It’s essential when you need to transmit binary data through text-only channels or embed binary content in text formats.\n\nWatch this quick explanation of how Base64 works (3 min):\n\n[![What is Base64? (3 min)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/8qkxeZmKmOY/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/8qkxeZmKmOY)\n\nHere’s how it works:\n\n* It takes 3 bytes (24 bits) and converts them into 4 ASCII characters\n* … using 64 characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, + and / (padding with `=` to make the length a multiple of 4)\n* There’s a URL-safe variant of Base64 that replaces + and / with - and \\_ to avoid issues in URLs\n* Base64 adds ~33% overhead (since every 3 bytes becomes 4 characters)\n\nCommon Python operations with Base64:\n\n```\nimport base64\n\n# Basic encoding/decoding\ntext = \"Hello, World!\"\n# Convert text to base64\nencoded = base64.b64encode(text.encode()).decode()  # SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ==\n# Convert base64 back to text\ndecoded = base64.b64decode(encoded).decode()        # Hello, World!\n# Convert to URL-safe base64\nurl_safe = base64.urlsafe_b64encode(text.encode()).decode()  # SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ==\n\n# Working with binary files (e.g., images)\nwith open('image.png', 'rb') as f:\n    binary_data = f.read()\n    image_b64 = base64.b64encode(binary_data).decode()\n\n# Data URI example (embed images in HTML/CSS)\ndata_uri = f\"data:image/png;base64,{image_b64}\"Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\nData URIs allow embedding binary data directly in HTML/CSS. This reduces the number of HTTP requests and also works offline. But it increases the file size.\n\nFor example, here’s an SVG image embedded as a data URI:\n\n```\n<img\n  src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAzMiAzMiI+PGNpcmNsZSBjeD0iMTYiIGN5PSIxNiIgcj0iMTUiIGZpbGw9IiMyNTYzZWIiLz48cGF0aCBmaWxsPSIjZmZmIiBkPSJtMTYgNyAyIDcgNyAyLTcgMi0yIDctMi03LTctMiA3LTJaIi8+PC9zdmc+\"\n/>Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\nBase64 is used in many places:\n\n* JSON: Encoding binary data in JSON payloads\n* Email: MIME attachments encoding\n* Auth: HTTP Basic Authentication headers\n* JWT: Encoding tokens in web authentication\n* SSL/TLS: PEM certificate format\n* SAML: Encoding assertions in SSO\n* Git: Encoding binary files in patches\n\nTools for working with Base64:\n\n* [Base64 Decoder/Encoder](https://www.base64decode.org/) for online encoding/decoding\n* [data: URI Generator](https://dopiaza.org/tools/datauri/index.php) converts files to Data URIs\n\n[Previous\n\nLLM Text Extraction](#/llm-text-extraction)\n\n[Next\n\nVision Models](#/vision-models)"

Often, pages have dozens of images. Image analysis runs over thousands of images. The cost of storage and bandwidth can grow over time.\n\nHere are things you should know when you’re compressing images:\n\n* **Image dimensions** are the width and height of the image in pixels. This impacts image size a lot\n* **Lossless** compression (PNG, WebP) preserves exact data\n* **Lossy** compression (JPEG, WebP) removes some data for smaller files\n* **Vector** formats (SVG) scale without quality loss\n* **WebP** is the modern standard, supporting both lossy and lossless\n\nHere’s a rule of thumb you can use as of 2025.\n\n* Use SVG if you can (i.e. if it’s vector graphics or you can convert it to one)\n* Else, reduce the image to as small as you can, and save as (lossy or lossless) WebP\n\nCommon operations with Python:\n\n```\nfrom pathlib import Path\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport io\n\nasync def compress_image(input_path: Path, output_path: Path, quality: int = 85) -> None:\n    \"\"\"Compress an image while maintaining reasonable quality.\"\"\"\n    with Image.open(input_path) as img:\n        # Convert RGBA to RGB if needed\n        if img.mode == 'RGBA':\n            img = img.convert('RGB')\n        # Optimize for web\n        img.save(output_path, 'WEBP', quality=quality, optimize=True)\n\n# Batch process images\npaths = Path('images').glob('*.jpg')\nfor p in paths:\n    await compress_image(p, p.with_suffix('.webp'))Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\nCommand line tools include [cwebp](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/cwebp), [pngquant](https://pngquant.org/), [jpegoptim](https://github.com/tjko/jpegoptim), and [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/).\n\n```\n# Convert to WebP\ncwebp -q 85 input.png -o output.webp\n\n# Optimize PNG\npngquant --quality=65-80 image.png\n\n# Optimize JPEG\njpegoptim --strip-all --all-progressive --max=85 image.jpg\n\n# Convert and resize\nconvert input.jpg -resize 800x600 output.jpg\n\n# Batch convert\nmogrify -format webp -quality 85 *.jpgCopy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\nWatch this video on modern image formats and optimization (15 min):\n\n[![Modern Image Optimization (15 min)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/F1kYBnY6mwg/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/F1kYBnY6mwg)\n\nTools for image optimization:\n\n* [squoosh.app](https://squoosh.app/): Browser-based compression\n* [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/): GUI tool for Mac\n* [sharp](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/): Node.js image processing\n* [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/): Python imaging library\n\n[Previous\n\nMarkdown](#/markdown)\n\n[Next\n\nStatic hosting: GitHub Pages](#/github-pages)"

You can can use `numpy` for these tasks.)\n\nVector databases are an evolving space.\n\nThe first generation of vector databases were written in C and typically used an algorithm called [HNSW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_navigable_small_world) (a way to approximately find the nearest neighbor). Some popular ones are:\n\n* **[chroma 19,637 ⭐ May 2025](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma)**\n* **[qdrant 23,341 ⭐ May 2025](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant)**\n* **[lancedb 6,327 ⭐ May 2025](https://github.com/lancedb/lancedb)**\n* **[faiss 34,684 ⭐ May 2025](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss)**\n* **[milvus 34,476 ⭐ May 2025](https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus)**\n* **[weaviate 13,222 ⭐ May 2025](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate)**\n\nIn addition, most relational databases now support vector search. For example:\n\n* **[DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/)**: Supports vector search with [`vss`](https://duckdb.org/docs/extensions/vss.html).\n* **[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/)**: Supports vector search with [`sqlite-vec`](https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-vec).\n* **[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)**: Supports vector search with [`pgvector`](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector).\n\nTake a look at this [Vector DB Comparison](https://superlinked.com/vector-db-comparison).\n\nWatch this Vector Database Tutorial (3 min):\n\n[![Vector databases are so hot right now.

We can use the regular expression above for the search and `\"\\1\"` for the value – it inserts captured group enclosed in double quotes.\n\n```\n# Replace [datetime] etc. with \"datetime\" and save as log.csv\n!sed 's/\\[\\([^]]*\\)\\]/\"\\1\"/' s-anand.net-Apr-2024 > log.csvCopy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\n```\n# We should now have a log.csv that's roughly the same size as the original file.\n!ls -lCopy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\n```\ntotal 101660\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 52044491 Jun  9 05:19 log.csv\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root     4096 Jun  6 14:21 sample_data\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 52044491 Jun  9 05:18 s-anand.net-Apr-2024Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\nYou can download this `log.csv` and open it in Excel as a CSV file with space as the delimiter.\n\nBut when I did that, I faced another problem. Some of the lines had extra columns.\n\nThat’s because the “User Agent” values sometimes contain a quote. CSV files are supposed to escape quotes with `\"\"` – two double quotes. But Apache uses `\\\"` instead.\n\nI’ll leave it as an exercise for you to fix that.\n\n[More commands](#/data-preparation-in-the-shell?id=more-commands)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe’ve covered the commands most often used to process data before analysis.\n\nHere are a few more that you’ll find useful.\n\n* `cat` concatenates multiple files. You can join multiple log files with this, for example\n* `awk` is almost a full-fledged programming interface. It’s often used for summing up values\n* `less` lets you open and read files, scrolling through it\n\nYou can read the book [Data Science at the Command Line](https://jeroenjanssens.com/dsatcl/) for more tools and examples.\n\n[Previous\n\nData Aggregation in Excel](#/data-aggregation-in-excel)\n\n[Next\n\nData Preparation in the Editor](#/data-preparation-in-the-editor)"

This tutorial explores various command-line tools for converting PDFs to Markdown format, with a focus on preserving structure and formatting suitable for different use cases, including preparation for Large Language Models (LLMs).\n\nUse Cases:\n\n* **LLM training and fine-tuning**: Create clean text data from PDFs for AI model training\n* **Knowledge base creation**: Transform PDFs into searchable, editable markdown documents\n* **Content repurposing**: Convert academic papers and reports for web publication\n* **Data extraction**: Pull structured content from PDF documents for analysis\n* **Accessibility**: Convert PDFs to more accessible formats for screen readers\n* **Citation and reference management**: Extract bibliographic information from academic papers\n* **Documentation conversion**: Transform technical PDFs into maintainable documentation\n\n### [PyMuPDF4LLM](#/convert-pdfs-to-markdown?id=pymupdf4llm)\n\n[PyMuPDF4LLM](https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pymupdf4llm/) is a specialized component of the PyMuPDF library that generates Markdown specifically formatted for Large Language Models. It produces high-quality markdown with good preservation of document structure. It’s specifically optimized for producing text that works well with LLMs, removing irrelevant formatting while preserving semantic structure. Requires PyTorch, which adds dependencies but enables more advanced processing capabilities.\n\nPyMuPDF4LLM uses [MuPDF](https://mupdf.com/) as its PDF parsing engine. [PyMuPDF](https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/) is emerging as a strong default for PDF text extraction due to its accuracy and performance in handling complex PDF structures.\n\n```\nPYTHONUTF8=1 uv run --with pymupdf4llm python -c 'import pymupdf4llm; h = open(\"pymupdf4llm.md\", \"w\"); h.write(pymupdf4llm.to_markdown(\"$FILE.pdf\"))'Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\n* `PYTHONUTF8=1`: Forces Python to use UTF-8 encoding regardless of system locale\n* `uv run --with pymupdf4llm`: Uses uv package manager to run Python with the pymupdf4llm package\n* `python -c '...'`: Executes Python code directly from the command line\n* `import pymupdf4llm`: Imports the PDF-to-Markdown module\n* `h = open(\"pymupdf4llm.md\", \"w\")`: Creates a file to write the markdown output\n* `h.write(pymupdf4llm.to_markdown(\"$FILE.pdf\"))`: Converts the PDF to markdown and writes to file\n\n[Markitdown](#/convert-pdfs-to-markdown?id=markitdown)\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n[![Microsoft MarkItDown - Convert Files and Office Documents to Markdown - Install Locally (9 min)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/v65Oyddfxeg/sddefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/v65Oyddfxeg)\n\n[Markitdown](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown) is Microsoft’s tool for converting various document formats to Markdown, including PDFs, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, and ZIP files. It’s a versatile multi-format converter that handles PDFs via PDFMiner, DOCX via Mammoth, XLSX via Pandas, and PPTX via Python-PPTX. Good for batch processing of mixed document types. The quality of PDF conversion is generally good but may struggle with complex layouts or heavily formatted documents.\n\n```\nPYTHONUTF8=1 uvx markitdown $FILE.pdf > markitdown.mdCopy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\n* `PYTHONUTF8=1`: Forces Python to use UTF-8 encoding\n* `uvx markitdown`: Runs the markitdown tool via the uv package manager\n* `$FILE.pdf`: The input PDF file\n* `> markitdown.md`: Redirects output to a markdown file\n\n### [Unstructured](#/convert-pdfs-to-markdown?id=unstructured)\n\n[Unstructured](https://unstructured.io/) is rapidly becoming the de facto library for parsing over 40 different file types. It is excellent for extracting text and tables from diverse document formats. Particularly useful for generating clean content to pass to LLMs. Strong community support and actively maintained.\n\n[GROBID](#/convert-pdfs-to-markdown?id=grobid)\n----------------------------------------------\n\nIf you specifically need to parse references from text-native PDFs or reliably OCR’ed ones, [GROBID](https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid) remains the de facto choice. It excels at extracting structured bibliographic information with high accuracy.\n\n```\n# Start GROBID service\ndocker run -t --rm -p 8070:8070 lfoppiano/grobid:0.7.2\n\n# Process PDF with curl\ncurl -X POST -F \"input=@paper.pdf\" localhost:8070/api/processFulltextDocument > references.tei.xmlCopy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\n### [Mistral OCR API](#/convert-pdfs-to-markdown?id=mistral-ocr-api)\n\n[Mistral OCR](https://mistral.ai/products/ocr/) offers an end-to-end cloud API that preserves both text and layout, making it easier to isolate specific sections like References. It shows the most promise currently, though it requires post-processing.\n\n[Azure Document Intelligence API](#/convert-pdfs-to-markdown?id=azure-document-intelligence-api)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor enterprise users already in the Microsoft ecosystem, [Azure Document Intelligence](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/document-intelligence) provides excellent raw OCR with enterprise SLAs. May require custom model training or post-processing to match GROBID’s reference extraction capabilities.\n\n### [Other libraries](#/convert-pdfs-to-markdown?id=other-libraries)\n\n[Docling](https://github.com/DS4SD/docling) is IBM’s document understanding library that supports PDF conversion. It can be challenging to install, particularly on Windows and some Linux distributions. Offers advanced document understanding capabilities beyond simple text extraction.\n\n[MegaParse](https://github.com/QuivrHQ/MegaParse) takes a comprehensive approach using LibreOffice, Pandoc, Tesseract OCR, and other tools. It has Robust handling of different document types but requires an OpenAI API key for some features. Good for complex documents but has significant dependencies.\n\n[Comparison of PDF-to-Markdown Tools](#/convert-pdfs-to-markdown?id=comparison-of-pdf-to-markdown-tools)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n| Tool | Strengths | Weaknesses | Best For |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| PyMuPDF4LLM | Structure preservation, LLM optimization | Requires PyTorch | AI training data, semantic structure |\n| Markitdown | Multi-format support, simple usage | Less precise layout handling | Batch processing, mixed documents |\n| Unstructured | Wide format support, active development | Can be resource-intensive | Production pipelines, integration |\n| GROBID | Reference extraction excellence | Narrower use case | Academic papers, citations |\n| Docling | Advanced document understanding | Installation difficulties | Research applications |\n| MegaParse | Comprehensive approach | Requires OpenAI API | Complex documents, OCR needs |\n\nHow to pick:\n\n* **Need LLM-ready content?** PyMuPDF4LLM is specifically designed for this\n* **Working with multiple document formats?** Markitdown handles diverse inputs\n* **Extracting academic references?** GROBID remains the standard\n* **Building a production pipeline?** Unstructured offers the best integration options\n* **Handling complex layouts?** Consider commercial OCR like Mistral or Azure Document Intelligence\n\nThe optimal approach depends on your specific requirements regarding accuracy, structure preservation, and the intended use of the extracted content.\n\n[Tips for Optimal PDF Conversion](#/convert-pdfs-to-markdown?id=tips-for-optimal-pdf-conversion)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1. **Pre-process PDFs** when possible:\n\n   ```\n   # Optimize a PDF for text extraction first\n   ocrmypdf --optimize 3 --skip-text input.pdf optimized.pdfCopy to clipboardErrorCopied\n   ```\n2. **Try multiple tools** on the same document to compare results:\n3. **Handle scanned PDFs** appropriately:\n\n   ```\n   # For scanned documents, run OCR first\n   ocrmypdf --force-ocr input.pdf ocr_ready.pdf\n   PYTHONUTF8=1 uvx markitdown ocr_ready.pdf > markitdown.mdCopy to clipboardErrorCopied\n   ```\n4. **Consider post-processing** for better results:\n\n   ```\n   # Simple post-processing example\n   sed -i 's/\\([A-Z]\\)\\./\\1\\.\\n/g' output.md  # Add line breaks after sentencesCopy to clipboardErrorCopied\n   ```\n\n[Previous\n\nScraping PDFs with Tabula](#/scraping-pdfs-with-tabula)\n\n[Next\n\nConvert HTML to Markdown](#/convert-html-to-markdown)"

Instead of relying solely on a general-purpose LLM, RAG lets you feed it the most relevant chunks from your corpus at query time, improving accuracy, reducing hallucinations, and allowing you to answer domain‑specific questions without fine‑tuning.\n\nIn particular, you can answer questions that are hard to answer with a keyword search. For example:\n\n```\nQ=\"What does the author affectionately call the => syntax?\"\n# Answer: fat arrow\n\nQ=\"What lets you walk every child node of a ts.Node?\"\n# Answer: node.getChildren()\n\nQ=\"What are code pieces like comments and whitespace that aren’t in the AST called?\"\n# Answer: trivia\n\nQ=\"Which operator converts any value into an explicit boolean?\"\n# Answer: !!Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\nYou can implement RAG entirely from your terminal, without writing a single line of application code. Below is a step‑by‑step example using the TypeScript book as a data source.\n\n### [1. Clone the repository](#/rag-cli?id=_1-clone-the-repository)\n\n```\ngit clone --depth 1 https://github.com/basarat/typescript-book\ncd typescript-bookCopy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\n* `--depth 1` fetches only the latest commit to minimize download size.\n* `cd typescript-book` moves into the project folder.\n\nYou’ll now be in a new folder `typescript-book` containing the repo.\n\n### [2. Split Markdown files into chunks](#/rag-cli?id=_2-split-markdown-files-into-chunks)\n\n```\n(\n  shopt -s globstar\n  for f in **/*.md; do\n    uvx --from split_markdown4gpt mdsplit4gpt \"$f\" --model gpt-4o --limit 4096 --separator \"===SPLIT===\" \\\n    | sed '1s/^/===SPLIT===\\n/' \\\n    | jq -R -s -c --arg file \"$f\" '\n      split(\"===SPLIT===\")[1:]\n      | to_entries\n      | map({\n          id: ($file + \"#\" + (.key | tostring)),\n          content: .value\n        })[]\n    '\n  done\n) | tee chunks.jsonCopy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\n* `shopt -s globstar`: lets `**/*.md` match Markdown files in all subdirectories. [bash shopt manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/The-Shopt-Builtin.html)\n* `uvx --from split_markdown4gpt mdsplit4gpt`: [a tool](https://github.com/twardoch/split-markdown4gpt) that splits Markdown into LLM‑sized chunks:\n  + `--model gpt-4o`: uses GPT‑4o token limits\n  + `--limit 4096`: max tokens per chunk\n  + `--separator \"===SPLIT===\"`: custom split marker\n* `sed '1s/^/===SPLIT===\\n/'`: ensures the very first chunk starts with the separator (GNU sed manual)\n* `jq -R -s -c --arg file \"$f\"`: uses [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/) to convert chunks to JSON\n  + `-R`: read raw input\n  + `-s`: slurp entire input into a single string\n  + `-c`: compact JSON output\n  + builds an array of objects `{id, content}`, where `id` is `filename#chunkIndex`\n* `tee chunks.json`: writes the resulting JSON array to `chunks.json` while printing it to stdout.\n\nYou’ll now have a `chunks.json` that has one `{id, content}` JSON object per line.\n\n### [3. Generate embeddings](#/rag-cli?id=_3-generate-embeddings)\n\n```\nllm embed-multi typescript-book --model 3-small --store --format nl chunks.jsonCopy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\n* `embed-multi`: computes embeddings for each entry in `chunks.json`.\n* `typescript-book`: a namespace or collection name for storage.\n* `--model 3-small`: selects the embedding model.\n* `--store`: save embeddings in the default backend.\n* `--format nl`: input is newline‑delimited JSON. [llm CLI embed-multi](https://github.com/kerenter/llm#embed-multi)\n\nThis stores the embeddings in a collection called `typescript-book`.\n\n```\nllm collections path  # shows where the collections are stored\nllm collections delete typescript-book  # deletes the typescript-book collectionCopy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\n### [4. Find similar topics](#/rag-cli?id=_4-find-similar-topics)\n\n```\nllm similar typescript-book -n 3 -c \"What does the author affectionately call the => syntax?\"Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\nThis returns the 3 chunksmost similar to the question posed.\n\n* `similar`: retrieves the top `n` most similar chunks from the embeddings store.\n* `-n 3`: return three results.\n* `-c`: the user’s query string.\n\n### [5. Answer a question using retrieved context](#/rag-cli?id=_5-answer-a-question-using-retrieved-context)\n\n```\nQ=\"What does the author affectionately call the => syntax?\"\nllm similar typescript-book -n 3 -c \"$Q\" \\\n  | jq '.content' \\\n  | llm -s \"$Q - Answer ONLY from these notes. Cite verbatim from notes.\" \\\n  | uvx streamdownCopy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\nThis answers the question in natural language following these steps:\n\n1. Store the query in `Q`.\n2. Retrieve the top 3 matching chunks.\n3. `jq '.content'` extracts just the text snippets.\n4. Pipe into `llm -s`, instructing the model:\n   * `-s`: stream a prompt directly to the LLM.\n   * `\"$Q - Answer ONLY from these notes. Cite verbatim from notes.\"`: ensures the response is grounded.\n5. `uvx streamdown` formats the streamed LLM output for easy reading.\n\n[Previous\n\nVector databases](#/vector-databases)\n\n[Next\n\nHybrid RAG with TypeSense](#/hybrid-rag-typesense)"

You can use this in YouTube, for example.\n  + `vtt`: A modern subtitle format.\n  + `txt`: Just the text transcript\n* `--output_dir`: The directory to save the output files. `source` indicates the source directory, i.e. where the input `$FILE` is\n* `--language`: The language of the input file. If you don’t specify it, it analyzes the first 30 seconds to auto-detect. You can speed it up by specifying it.\n\nRun `faster-whisper-xxl --help` for more options.\n\n[Gemini transcription](#/extracting-audio-and-transcripts?id=gemini-transcription)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) models from Google are notable in two ways:\n\n1. They have a *huge* input context window. Gemini 2.0 Flash can accept 1M tokens, for example.\n2. They can handle audio input.\n\nThis allows us to use Gemini to transcribe audio files.\n\nLLMs are not good at transcribing audio *faithfully*. They tend to correct errors and meander from what was said. But they are intelligent. That enables a few powerful workflows. Here are some examples:\n\n1. **Transcribe into other languages**. Gemini will handle the transcription and translation in a single step.\n2. **Summarize audio transcripts**. For example, convert a podcast into a tutorial, or a meeting recording into actions.\n3. **Legal Proceeding Analysis**. Extract case citations, dates, and other details from a legal debate.\n4. **Medical Consultation Summary**. Extract treatments, medications, details of next visit, etc. from a medical consultation.\n\nHere’s how to use Gemini to transcribe audio files.\n\n1. Get a [Gemini API key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) from Google AI Studio.\n2. Set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable to the API key.\n3. Set the `MP3_FILE` environment variable to the path of the MP3 file you want to transcribe.\n4. Run this code:\n\n   ```\n   curl -X POST https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-flash-002:streamGenerateContent?alt=sse \\\n     -H \"X-Goog-API-Key: $GEMINI_API_KEY\" \\\n     -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n     -d \"$(cat << EOF\n   {\n     \"contents\": [\n       {\n         \"role\": \"user\",\n         \"parts\": [\n           {\n             \"inline_data\": {\n               \"mime_type\": \"audio/mp3\",\n               \"data\": \"$(base64 --wrap=0 $MP3_FILE)\"\n             }\n           },\n           {\"text\": \"Transcribe this\"}\n         ]\n       }\n     ]\n   }\n   EOF\n   )\"Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\n   ```\n\n[Previous\n\nTransforming Images](#/transforming-images)\n\n[Next\n\n6.

Or see garbage when you load a CSV file? This video explains why. It covers how computers store text (called character encoding) and why it sometimes goes wonky.\n\nLearn about ASCII (the original 7-bit encoding system that could only handle 128 characters), why that wasn’t enough for global languages, and how modern solutions like Unicode save the day by letting us use any character from any language.\n\nSome programs try to guess encodings (sometimes badly!). A signature called BOM (Byte Order Mark)helps computers know exactly how to read text files correctly.\n\nLearn how Unicode, UTF-8 and character encoding works. This is a common gotcha when building apps that handle international text - something bootcamps often skip but developers and data scientists regularly face in the real world.\n\nUnicode is fundamental for data scientists working with international data. Here are key concepts you need to understand:\n\n* **Character Encodings**: Different ways to represent text in computers\n  + ASCII (7-bit): Limited to 128 characters, English-only\n  + UTF-8: Variable-width encoding, backwards compatible with ASCII\n  + UTF-16: Fixed-width encoding, used in Windows and Java\n  + UTF-32: Fixed-width encoding, memory inefficient but simple\n\nCommon encoding issues you’ll encounter:\n\n```\n# Reading files with explicit encoding\nwith open('file.txt', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n    text = f.read()\n\n# Handling encoding errors\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.read_csv('data.csv', encoding='utf-8', errors='replace')\n\n# Detecting file encoding\nimport chardet\nwith open('unknown.txt', 'rb') as f:\n    result = chardet.detect(f.read())\nprint(result['encoding'])Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\n[![Code Pages, Character Encoding, Unicode, UTF-8 and the BOM - Computer Stuff They Didn't Teach You #2 (17 min)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jeIBNn5Y5fI/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/jeIBNn5Y5fI)\n\n[Previous\n\nJavaScript tools: npx](#/npx)\n\n[Next\n\nBrowser: DevTools](#/devtools)"

Data scientists need CORS for APIs serving data or analysis to a browser on a different domain.\n\nWatch this practical explanation of CORS (3 min):\n\n[![CORS in 100 Seconds](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/4KHiSt0oLJ0/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/4KHiSt0oLJ0)\n\nKey CORS concepts:\n\n* **Same-Origin Policy**: Browsers block requests between different origins by default\n* **CORS Headers**: Server responses must include specific headers to allow cross-origin requests\n* **Preflight Requests**: Browsers send OPTIONS requests to check if the actual request is allowed\n* **Credentials**: Special handling required for requests with cookies or authentication\n\nIf you’re exposing your API with a GET request publicly, the only thing you need to do is set the HTTP header `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`.\n\nHere are other common CORS headers:\n\n```\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: https://example.com\nAccess-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE\nAccess-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization\nAccess-Control-Allow-Credentials: trueCopy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\nTo implement CORS in FastAPI, use the [`CORSMiddleware` middleware](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/cors/):\n\n```\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI\nfrom fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware\n\napp = FastAPI()\n\napp.add_middleware(CORSMiddleware, allow_origins=[\"*\"]) # Allow GET requests from all origins\n# Or, provide more granular control:\napp.add_middleware(\n    CORSMiddleware,\n    allow_origins=[\"https://example.com\"],  # Allow a specific domain\n    allow_credentials=True,  # Allow cookies\n    allow_methods=[\"GET\", \"POST\", \"PUT\", \"DELETE\"],  # Allow specific methods\n    allow_headers=[\"*\"],  # Allow all headers\n)Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\nTesting CORS with JavaScript:\n\n```\n// Simple request\nconst response = await fetch(\"https://api.example.com/data\", {\n  method: \"GET\",\n  headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" },\n});\n\n// Request with credentials\nconst response = await fetch(\"https://api.example.com/data\", {\n  credentials: \"include\",\n  headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" },\n});Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\nUseful CORS debugging tools:\n\n* [CORS Checker](https://cors-test.codehappy.dev/): Test CORS configurations\n* Browser DevTools Network tab: Inspect CORS headers and preflight requests\n* [cors-anywhere](https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere): CORS proxy for development\n\nCommon CORS errors and solutions:\n\n* `No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header`: Configure server to send proper CORS headers\n* `Request header field not allowed`: Add required headers to `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`\n* `Credentials flag`: Set both `credentials: 'include'` and `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`\n* `Wild card error`: Cannot use `*` with credentials; specify exact origins\n\n[Previous\n\nTunneling: ngrok](#/ngrok)\n\n[Next\n\nREST APIs](#/rest-apis)"

Explore:\n\n* [Anthropic Prompt Optimizer](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompt-improver)\n* [OpenAI Prompt Generation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-generation)\n* [Google AI-powered prompt writing tools](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/ai-powered-prompt-writing)\n\n### [Be clear, direct, and detailed](#/prompt-engineering?id=be-clear-direct-and-detailed)\n\nBe explicit and thorough. Include all necessary context, goals, and details so the model understands the full picture.\n\n* **BAD**: *Explain gravitation lensing.* (Reason: Vague and lacks context or detail.)\n* **GOOD**: *Explain the concept of gravitational lensing to a high school student who understands basic physics, including how it’s observed and its significance in astronomy.* (Reason: Specifies the audience, scope, and focus.)\n\n> When you ask a question, don’t be vague. Spell it out. Give every detail the listener needs.\n> The clearer you are, the better the answer you’ll get.\n> For example, don’t just say, Explain Gravitation Lensing.\n> Say, Explain the concept of gravitational lensing to a high school student who understands basic physics, including how it’s observed and its significance in astronomy.\n\n[Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/be-clear-and-direct)\n| [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering#tactic-include-details-in-your-query-to-get-more-relevant-answers)\n| [Google](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/clear-instructions)\n\n### [Give examples](#/prompt-engineering?id=give-examples)\n\nProvide 2-3 relevant examples to guide the model on the style, structure, or format you expect. This helps the model produce outputs consistent with your desired style.\n\n* **BAD**: *Explain how to tie a bow tie.* (Reason: No examples or reference points given.)\n* **GOOD**:\n  *Explain how to tie a bow tie. For example:*\n\n  1. *To tie a shoelace, you cross the laces and pull them tight…*\n  2. *To tie a necktie, you place it around the collar and loop it through…*\n\n  *Now, apply a similar step-by-step style to describe how to tie a bow tie.* (Reason: Provides clear examples and a pattern to follow.)\n\n> Give examples to the model. If you want someone to build a house, show them a sketch. Don’t just say ‘build something.’\n> Giving examples is like showing a pattern. It makes everything easier to follow.\n\n[Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/multishot-prompting)\n| [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering#tactic-provide-examples)\n| [Google](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/few-shot-examples)\n\n### [Think step by step](#/prompt-engineering?id=think-step-by-step)\n\nInstruct the model to reason through the problem step by step. This leads to more logical, well-structured answers.\n\n* **BAD**: *Given this transcript, is the customer satisfied?* (Reason: No prompt for structured reasoning.)\n* **GOOD**: *Given this transcript, is the customer satisfied? Think step by step.* (Reason: Directly instructs the model to break down reasoning into steps.)\n\n> Ask the model to think step by step. Don’t ask the model to just give the final answer right away.\n> That’s like asking someone to answer with the first thing that pops into their head.\n> Instead, ask them to break down their thought process into simple moves — like showing each rung of a ladder as they climb.\n> For example, when thinking step by step, the model could, A, list each customer question, B, find out if it was addressed, and C, decide that the agent answered only 2 out of the 3 questions.\n\n[Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/chain-of-thought)\n| [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering#strategy-give-models-time-to-think)\n| [Google](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/break-down-prompts)\n\n### [Assign a role](#/prompt-engineering?id=assign-a-role)\n\nSpecify a role or persona for the model. This provides context and helps tailor the response style.\n\n* **BAD**: *Explain how to fix a software bug.* (Reason: No role or perspective given.)\n* **GOOD**: *You are a seasoned software engineer. Explain how to fix a software bug in legacy code, including the debugging and testing process.* (Reason: Assigns a clear, knowledgeable persona, guiding the style and depth.)\n\n> Tell the model who they are. Maybe they’re a seasoned software engineer fixing a legacy bug, or an experienced copy editor revising a publication.\n> By clearly telling the model who they are, you help them speak with just the right expertise and style.\n> Suddenly, your explanation sounds like it’s coming from a true specialist, not a random voice.\n\n[Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/system-prompts)\n| [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering#tactic-ask-the-model-to-adopt-a-persona)\n| [Google](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/assign-role)\n\n### [Use XML to structure your prompt](#/prompt-engineering?id=use-xml-to-structure-your-prompt)\n\nUse XML tags to separate different parts of the prompt clearly. This helps the model understand structure and requirements.\n\n* **BAD**: *Here’s what I want: Provide a summary and then an example.* (Reason: Unstructured, no clear separation of tasks.)\n* **GOOD**:\n\n  ```\n  <instructions>\n    Provide a summary of the concept of machine learning.\n  </instructions>\n  <example>\n    Then provide a simple, concrete example of a machine learning application (e.g., an email spam filter).\n  </example>Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\n  ```\n\n  (Reason: Uses XML tags to clearly distinguish instructions from examples.)\n\n> Think of your request like a box. XML tags are neat little labels on that box.\n> They help keep parts sorted, so nothing gets lost in the shuffle.\n\n[Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/use-xml-tags)\n| [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering#tactic-use-delimiters-to-clearly-indicate-distinct-parts-of-the-input)\n| [Google](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/structure-prompts)\n\n### [Use Markdown to format your output](#/prompt-engineering?id=use-markdown-to-format-your-output)\n\nEncourage the model to use Markdown for headings, lists, code blocks, and other formatting features to produce structured, easily readable answers.\n\n* **BAD**: *Give me the steps in plain text.* (Reason: No specific formatting instructions, less readable.)\n* **GOOD**: *Provide the steps in a markdown-formatted list with ### headings for each section and numbered bullet points.* (Reason: Directly instructs to use Markdown formatting, making output more structured and clear.)\n* **BAD**: *Correct the spelling and show the corrections.* (Reason: No specific formatting instructions)\n* **GOOD**: *Correct the spelling, showing <ins>additions</ins> and <del>deletions</del>.* (Reason: Directly instructs to use HTML formatting, making output more structured and clear.)\n\n> Markdown is a simple formatting language that all models understand.\n> You can have them add neat headings, sections, bold highlights, and bullet points.\n> These make complex documents more scannable and easy on the eyes.\n\n### [Use JSON for machine-readable output](#/prompt-engineering?id=use-json-for-machine-readable-output)\n\nWhen you need structured data, ask for a JSON-formatted response. This ensures the output is machine-readable and organized.\n\n* **BAD**: *Just list the items.* (Reason: Unstructured plain text makes parsing harder.)\n* **GOOD**:\n\n  ```\n  Organize as an array of objects in a JSON format, like this:\n\n  ```json\n  [\n    { \"name\": \"Item 1\", \"description\": \"Description of Item 1\" },\n    { \"name\": \"Item 2\", \"description\": \"Description of Item 2\" },\n    { \"name\": \"Item 3\", \"description\": \"Description of Item 3\" }\n  ]\n  ```Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\n  ```\n\n  (Reason: Instructing JSON format ensures structured, machine-readable output.)\n\nNote: Always use [JSON schema](#/playground?id=attachments) if possible. [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/) is a way to describe the structure of JSON data. An easy way to get the JSON schema is to give ChatGPT sample output and ask it to generate the schema.\n\n> Imagine you’re organizing data for a big project. Plain text is like dumping everything into one messy pile — it’s hard to find what you need later.\n> JSON, on the other hand, is like packing your data into neat, labeled boxes within boxes.\n> Everything has its place: fields like ‘name,’ ‘description,’ and ‘value’ make the data easy to read, especially for machines.\n> For example, instead of just listing items, you can structure them as a JSON array, with each item as an object.\n> That way, when you hand it to a program, it’s all clear and ready to use.\n\n### [Prefer Yes/No answers](#/prompt-engineering?id=prefer-yesno-answers)\n\nConvert rating or percentage questions into Yes/No queries. LLMs handle binary choices better than numeric scales.\n\n* **BAD**: *On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you that this method works?* (Reason: Asks for a numeric rating, which can be imprecise.)\n* **GOOD**: *Is this method likely to work as intended? Please give a reasoning and then answer Yes or No.* (Reason: A binary question simplifies the response and clarifies what’s being asked.)\n\n> Don’t ask ‘On a scale of one to five…’. Models are not good with numbers.\n> They don’t know how to grade something 7 versus 8 on a 10 point scale. ‘Yes or no?’ is simple. It’s clear. It’s quick.\n> So, break your question into simple parts that they can answer with just a yes or a no.\n\n### [Ask for reason first, then the answer](#/prompt-engineering?id=ask-for-reason-first-then-the-answer)\n\nInstruct the model to provide its reasoning steps *before* stating the final answer. This makes it less likely to justify itself and more likely to think deeper, leading to more accurate results.\n\n* **BAD**: *What is the best route to take?* (Reason: Direct question without prompting reasoning steps first.)\n* **GOOD**: *First, explain your reasoning step by step for how you determine the best route. Then, after you’ve reasoned it out, state your final recommendation for the best route.* (Reason: Forces the model to show its reasoning process before giving the final answer.)\n\n> BEFORE making its final choice, have the model talk through their thinking. Reasoning first, answer second.\n> That way, the model won’t be tempted to justify an answer that they gave impulsively. It is also more likely to think deeper.\n\n### [Use proper spelling and grammar](#/prompt-engineering?id=use-proper-spelling-and-grammar)\n\nA well-written, grammatically correct prompt clarifies expectations. Poorly structured prompts can confuse the model.\n\n* **BAD**: *xplin wht the weirless netork do? make shur to giv me a anser??* (Reason: Poor spelling and unclear instructions.)\n* **GOOD**: *Explain what a wireless network does. Please provide a detailed, step-by-step explanation.* (Reason: Proper spelling and clarity lead to a more coherent response.)\n\n> If your question sounds like gibberish, expect a messy answer. Speak cleanly.\n> When you do, the response will be much clearer.\n\n[Video Tutorials](#/prompt-engineering?id=video-tutorials)\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nWatch [Prompt Engineering Tutorial – Master ChatGPT and LLM Responses (41 min)](https://youtu.be/_ZvnD73m40o).

Podman is compatible with Docker and has better security (and a slightly more open license). In this course, we recommend Podman but Docker works in the same way.\n\nInitialize the container engine:\n\n```\npodman machine init\npodman machine startCopy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\nCommon Operations.

This tutorial shows how to automate data collection from websites using GitHub Actions workflows.\n\n### [Key Concepts](#/scheduled-scraping-with-github-actions?id=key-concepts)\n\n* **Scheduling**: Use [cron syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule) to run scrapers at specific times\n* **Dependencies**: Install required packages like `httpx`, `lxml`\n* **Data Storage**: Save scraped data to files and commit back to the repository\n* **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling for network issues and HTML parsing\n* **Rate Limiting**: Respect website terms of service and implement delays between requests\n\nHere’s a sample `scrape.py` that scrapes the IMDb Top 250 movies using httpx and lxml:\n\n```\nimport json\nimport httpx\nfrom datetime import datetime, UTC\nfrom lxml import html\nfrom typing import List, Dict\n\n\ndef scrape_imdb() -> List[Dict[str, str]]:\n    \"\"\"Scrape IMDb Top 250 movies using httpx and lxml.\n\n    Returns:\n        List of dictionaries containing movie title, year, and rating.\n    \"\"\"\n    headers = {\"User-Agent\": \"Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; IMDbBot/1.0)\"}\n    response = httpx.get(\"https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/\", headers=headers)\n    response.raise_for_status()\n\n    tree = html.fromstring(response.text)\n    movies = []\n\n    for item in tree.cssselect(\".ipc-metadata-list-summary-item\"):\n        title = (\n            item.cssselect(\".ipc-title__text\")[0].text_content()\n            if item.cssselect(\".ipc-title__text\")\n            else None\n        )\n        year = (\n            item.cssselect(\".cli-title-metadata span\")[0].text_content()\n            if item.cssselect(\".cli-title-metadata span\")\n            else None\n        )\n        rating = (\n            item.cssselect(\".ipc-rating-star\")[0].text_content()\n            if item.cssselect(\".ipc-rating-star\")\n            else None\n        )\n\n        if title and year and rating:\n            movies.append({\"title\": title, \"year\": year, \"rating\": rating})\n\n    return movies\n\n\n# Scrape data and save with timestamp\nnow = datetime.now(UTC)\nwith open(f'imdb-top250-{now.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d\")}.json', \"a\") as f:\n    f.write(json.dumps({\"timestamp\": now.isoformat(), \"movies\": scrape_imdb()}) + \"\\n\")Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\nHere’s a sample `.github/workflows/imdb-top250.yml` that runs the scraper daily and saves the data:\n\n```\nname: Scrape IMDb Top 250\n\non:\n  schedule:\n    # Runs at 00:00 UTC every day\n    - cron: \"0 0 * * *\"\n  workflow_dispatch: # Allow manual triggers\n\njobs:\n  scrape-imdb:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    permissions:\n      contents: write\n\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout repository\n        uses: actions/checkout@v4\n\n      - name: Install uv\n        uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v5\n\n      - name: Run scraper\n        run: | # python\n          uv run --with httpx,lxml,cssselect python scrape.py\n\n      - name: Commit and push changes\n        run: |\n          git config --local user.email \"github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com\"\n          git config --local user.name \"github-actions[bot]\"\n          git add *.json\n          git commit -m \"Update IMDb Top 250 data [skip ci]\" || exit 0\n          git pushCopy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\n### [Best Practices](#/scheduled-scraping-with-github-actions?id=best-practices)\n\n1. **Cache Dependencies**: Use GitHub’s caching to speed up package installation\n2. **Handle Errors**: Implement retries and error logging\n3. **Rate Limiting**: Add delays between requests to avoid overwhelming servers\n4. **Data Validation**: Verify scraped data structure before saving\n5. **Monitoring**: Set up notifications for workflow failures\n\n### [Tools and Resources](#/scheduled-scraping-with-github-actions?id=tools-and-resources)\n\n* [httpx](https://www.python-httpx.org/): Async HTTP client\n* [GitHub Actions Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions)\n* [GitHub Actions Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)\n\n### [Video Tutorials](#/scheduled-scraping-with-github-actions?id=video-tutorials)\n\n[![How to run Github Actions on a Schedule](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/eJG86J200nM/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/eJG86J200nM)\n\n[Previous\n\nWeb Automation with Playwright](#/web-automation-with-playwright)\n\n[Next\n\nScraping emarketer.com](#/scraping-emarketer)"

It is pre-installed in many UNIX distributions and easy to install.\n\n[![Scraping Websites using Wget (8 min)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pLfH5TZBGXo/sddefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/pLfH5TZBGXo)\n\nTo crawl the [IIT Madras Data Science Program website](https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/) for example, you could run:\n\n```\nwget \\\n  --recursive \\\n  --level=3 \\\n  --no-parent \\\n  --convert-links \\\n  --adjust-extension \\\n  --compression=auto \\\n  --accept html,htm \\\n  --directory-prefix=./ds \\\n  https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\nHere’s what each option does:\n\n* `--recursive`: Enables recursive downloading (following links)\n* `--level=3`: Limits recursion depth to 3 levels from the initial URL\n* `--no-parent`: Restricts crawling to only URLs below the initial directory\n* `--convert-links`: Converts all links in downloaded documents to work locally\n* `--adjust-extension`: Adds proper extensions to files (.html, .jpg, etc.) based on MIME types\n* `--compression=auto`: Automatically handles compressed content (gzip, deflate)\n* `--accept html,htm`: Only downloads files with these extensions\n* `--directory-prefix=./ds`: Saves all downloaded files to the specified directory\n\n[wget2](https://gitlab.com/gnuwget/wget2) is a better version of `wget` and supports HTTP2, parallel connections, and only updates modified sites. The syntax is (mostly) the same.\n\n```\nwget2 \\\n  --recursive \\\n  --level=3 \\\n  --no-parent \\\n  --convert-links \\\n  --adjust-extension \\\n  --compression=auto \\\n  --accept html,htm \\\n  --directory-prefix=./ds \\\n  https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\nThere are popular free and open-source alternatives to Wget:\n\n### [Wpull](#/crawling-cli?id=wpull)\n\n[Wpull](https://github.com/ArchiveTeam/wpull) is a wget‐compatible Python crawler that supports on-disk resumption, WARC output, and PhantomJS integration.\n\n```\nuvx wpull \\\n  --recursive \\\n  --level=3 \\\n  --no-parent \\\n  --convert-links \\\n  --adjust-extension \\\n  --compression=auto \\\n  --accept html,htm \\\n  --directory-prefix=./ds \\\n  https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\n### [HTTrack](#/crawling-cli?id=httrack)\n\n[HTTrack](https://www.httrack.com/html/fcguide.html) is dedicated website‐mirroring tool with rich filtering and link‐conversion options.\n\n```\nhttrack \"https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/\" \\\n  -O \"./ds\" \\\n  \"+*.study.iitm.ac.in/ds/*\" \\\n  -r3Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\n```\n\n### [Robots.txt](#/crawling-cli?id=robotstxt)\n\n`robots.txt` is a standard file found in a website’s root directory that specifies which parts of the site should not be accessed by web crawlers. It’s part of the Robots Exclusion Protocol, an ethical standard for web crawling.\n\n**Why it’s important**:\n\n* **Server load protection**: Prevents excessive traffic that could overload servers\n* **Privacy protection**: Keeps sensitive or private content from being indexed\n* **Legal compliance**: Respects website owners’ rights to control access to their content\n* **Ethical web citizenship**: Shows respect for website administrators’ wishes\n\n**How to override robots.txt restrictions**:\n\n* **wget, wget2**: Use `-e robots=off`\n* **httrack**: Use `-s0`\n* **wpull**: Use `--no-robots`\n\n**When to override robots.txt (use with discretion)**:\n\nOnly bypass `robots.txt` when:\n\n* You have explicit permission from the website owner\n* You’re crawling your own website\n* The content is publicly accessible and your crawling won’t cause server issues\n* You’re conducting authorized security testing\n\nRemember that bypassing `robots.txt` without legitimate reason may:\n\n* Violate terms of service\n* Lead to IP banning\n* Result in legal consequences in some jurisdictions\n* Cause reputation damage to your organization\n\nAlways use the minimum necessary crawling speed and scope, and consider contacting website administrators for permission when in doubt.\n\n[Previous\n\nScraping with Google Sheets](#/scraping-with-google-sheets)\n\n[Next\n\nBBC Weather API with Python](#/bbc-weather-api-with-python)"
